                            From the start of our home purchasing journey, Chris have been there with us.  He had been very accommodating to our requests, and always made sure we were taken care of.  His knowledge, professionalism, integrity, and hard work ethic are clear through out all of our interactions with him.  When we ran into a lot of hiccups during the closing, Chris was there helping us with every details as if he was buying his own house.  In addition to Chris, Joe was also there to help us.  Like Chris, Joe gave us advice, feedback, and superb customer service.  We definitely recommend the Kingdom Estate Realty team.

                            We worked with Chris Ho for purchasing our first house in Frisco, TX. He was with us together from A to Z by guiding us in right direction and providing his professional support. I really liked working with Chris Ho and would like to recommend his professional services to anyone in the market for realtor service. We want to work with him again to extend our future real estate plans.

He had always answered every call or email no matter what time of day or night it was. His professionalism, knowledge, honesty, and hard work ethic are much respected and appreciated. I will refer him to any my friends who have needs. He's a true professional and a genuinely nice person.

                            Chris is a man of integrity and honesty. His faith in Jesus Christ holds him to a higher standard when it comes to business practices. He is always looking out for your best interest and he will go above and beyond his call of duty to serve you. I highly recommend Chris for his patience and willingness to assist in buying or selling your house. As a seller, we were out of the country and questioned how we would sell our home. Chris took care of everything; he prepped the house, communicated regularly, and even deposited our check into our bank when our house sold!  We highly recommend Chris Ho. Thanks for everything, Chris!

Chris is professional and patient throughout the entire buying process. He is putting full attention on us, inquiring information from sellers, providing us home buying knowledge, and explaining each of the documents that we are signing. There is no doubt that we will recommend Chris to others who are looking for a realtor for any real estate transactions.

                            Chris is as professional as any Realtor I have worked with in my 17 years in the DFW area.  He was on top of every stage of the transaction, and kept it on track all the way to the Closing and beyond.  I hope we will do many more successful transactions in the future.  Thanks Chris
