<span class=pageheading>Making An Offer On A Home</span><br><br>
<span class=text>Okay, you've found the right home at the right price, how do you make an offer? 
Working with your real estate professional you need to do the following: </span>
<UL class="text">
<LI>Before making an offer get full disclosure on the condition of the property, 
any liens or back-taxes, easements, etc. Also get a copy of any neighborhood 
association rules and by-laws, if you have a home business and the association 
has restrictions on these kinds of activities then you need to know before you 
offer to buy. Consult a real estate attorney if you have questions and contact 
the association chairperson for clarifications. 
<LI>Get a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) of the home to find out what 
comparable homes in the area are selling at, your real estate professional can 
help you with this. 
<LI>In addition to the offer price put down, in writing, any contingencies or 
terms that you wish the seller to meet. If you want the living room carpet 
replaced then write that down in the offer. 
<LI>Keep contingencies reasonable so that you don't kill the deal, and make it 
negotiable. The seller may not think replacing the carpet is necessary but may 
acknowledge the fact that it'll need replacing within a year or two and knock 
off a few hundred dollars from the price. 
<LI>Other contingencies to consider: you won't close until your existing home is 
sold, that you secure the loan terms that you applied for, the house passes a 
termite inspection, and a clear title. 
<LI>Conveyances, if you are told that a major appliance comes with the home, 
make sure that it's mentioned in the offer. 
<LI>Also make sure all the details of the transaction are written down. Who pays 
the closing costs? The time frame of the closing date. After closing, when do 
you take possession? Cancellation terms. Inspections to be performed. 
<LI>When you make an offer you will be expected to put up an "earnest money 
deposit" to show that you are serious about buying the property, normally no 
more than 1-2% of the offer price. 
<LI>Keep in mind that when you make an offer it can become a contract, it only 
needs the seller's signature to become binding. Make sure your offer is 
reasonable and attainable for you and the seller. </LI></UL><span class=text>As a real estate
