<span class=pageheading>The Offer</span><br><br>
<DIV class=bbarticleBody>
<DIV class=text><BR><B>Writing 
an Offer to Purchase Real Estate</B><BR><BR>Once you find the home you want to 
buy, the next step is to write an offer – which is not as easy as it sounds. 
Your offer is the first step toward negotiating a sales contract with the 
seller. Since this is just the beginning of negotiations, you should put 
yourself in the seller’s shoes and imagine his or her reaction to everything you 
include. Your goal is to get what you want, and imagining the seller’s reactions 
will help you attain that goal.<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class=text>The offer is much more complicated than simply coming 
up with a price and saying, "This is what I’ll pay." Because of the huge dollar 
amounts involved, especially in today’s litigious society, both you and the 
seller want to build in protections and contingencies to protect your investment 
and limit your risk.<BR><BR>In an offer to purchase real estate, you include not 
only the price you are willing to pay, but other details of the purchase as 
well. This includes how you intend to finance the home, your down payment, who 
pays what closing costs, what inspections are performed, timetables, whether 
personal property is included in the purchase, terms of cancellation, any 
repairs you want performed, which professional services will be used, when you 
get physical possession of the property, and how to settle disputes should they 
occur.<BR><BR>It is certainly more involved than buying a car. And more 
important.<BR><BR>Buying a home is a major event for both the buyer and seller. 
It will affect your finances more than any other previous purchase or 
investment. The seller makes plans based on your offer that affect his finances, 
too. However, it is more important than just money. In the half-hour it takes to 
write an offer you are making decisions that affect how you live for the next 
several years, if not the rest of your life. The seller is going to review your 
offer carefully, because it also affects how he or she lives the rest of their 
life.<BR><BR>That sounds dramatic. It sounds like a cliché. Every real estate 
book or article you read says the same thing.<BR><BR>They all say it because it 
is true.<BR><BR><B>Contingencies in an Offer to Purchase Real 
Estate</B><BR><BR>In most purchase transactions there may be a slight challenge 
or two, but most things will go quite smoothly. However, you want to anticipate 
potential problems so that if something does go wrong, you can cancel the 
contract without penalty. These are called "contingencies" and you must be sure 
to include them when you offer to buy a home.<BR><BR>For example, some "move-up" 
buyers often agree to purchase a home before selling their previous home. Even 
if the home is already sold, it is probably a "pending sale" and has not closed. 
Therefore, you should make closing your own sale a condition of your offer. If 
you do not include this as a contingency, you may find yourself making two 
mortgage payments instead of one.<BR><BR>There are other common contingencies 
you should include in your offer. Since you probably need a mortgage to buy the 
home, a condition of your offer should be that you successfully obtain suitable 
financing. Another condition should be that the property appraises for at least 
what you agreed to pay for it. During the escrow period you are likely to 
require certain inspections, and another contingency should be that it pass 
those inspections.<BR><BR>Basically, contingencies protect you in case you 
cannot perform or choose not to perform on a promise to buy a home. If you 
cancel a contract without having built-in conditions and contingencies, you 
could find yourself forfeiting your earnest money deposit.<BR><BR>Or 
worse<BR><BR><B>Earnest Money Deposit in an Offer to Purchase Real 
Estate</B><BR><BR>After you have come up with an offer price, the next step is 
to determine how large a deposit you want to make with your offer. You want the 
"earnest money deposit" to be large enough to show the seller you are serious, 
but not so large you are placing significant funds at risk.<BR><BR>One 
recommendation is to make sure your deposit is less than two percent of your 
offered price. The reason for this is that if your deposit is larger than that, 
the lender will pay particular attention to how you came up with the funds. You 
might have to provide a copy of a canceled check along with a bank statement 
showing you had the money to begin with. Normally, this is not a problem, but if 
you have a short escrow period or are barely coming up with your down payment, 
it could pose an inconvenience.<BR><BR>Another reason to limit your deposit is 
"just in case." Although significant problems are the exception and not the 
rule, they do occur. "Just in case" there is a nasty or prolonged dispute 
between you and the seller, the less money you have tied up in a deposit, the 
fewer funds you have placed at risk.<BR><BR>As with practically everything in 
real estate, there are exceptions to this rule, too. During a hot market there 
may be multiple offers on the property that interests you. A large deposit may 
impress a seller enough so they will accept your offer instead of someone 
else’s, even when your unknown competitor is offering the same price or slightly 
higher.<BR><BR>Since large deposits do impress sellers, you may also find that 
by making a large deposit you can convince the seller to accept a lower offer. 
More money up front may save you money later.<BR><BR><B>The Closing Date in an 
Offer to Purchase Real Estate</B><BR><BR>It is absolutely essential that you 
include a closing date as part of your offer. This way both you and the seller 
can make plans for moving, and the seller can make plans for buying his or her 
next home. Though most transactions actually do close on the right date, do not 
be so inflexible that a delay creates insurmountable problems.<BR><BR>For 
example, if you are renting and need to give the landlord notice that you are 
moving out, you may want to allow a little flexibility. Otherwise, if your 
purchase closes a few days late you could find yourself staying in a motel with 
your belongings packed in a moving van somewhere while you pay storage 
costs.<BR><BR>There are also times when closing can be delayed by weeks, through 
no fault of your own. Have back-up plans prepared for such a 
contingency.<BR><BR><B>Transfer of Possession in an Offer to Purchase Real 
Estate</B><BR><BR>A transaction is considered "closed" once the deeds have been 
recorded. Then you own the home. However, it is not always possible for you to 
occupy it immediately. This can happen for several reasons, but the most common 
is that the seller may be purchasing a home, too. Usually, their purchase is 
scheduled to close simultaneously with your purchase of their home.<BR><BR>It is 
sort of like being at a red light when it turns green. Although all the cars see 
the light change at the same time, the guy at the back of the line doesn’t begin 
moving until all the cars ahead of him have started.<BR><BR>As a result, it has 
become customary to allow the seller up to a maximum of three days to turn over 
actual possession and keys to the home. When transfer of possession actually 
occurs should be clearly laid out in your offer to prevent confusion later.<BR>
