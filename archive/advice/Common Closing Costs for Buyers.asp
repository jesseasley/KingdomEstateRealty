<span class=pageheading>Common Closing Costs for Buyers</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=text>The lender must disclose a good faith estimate of all
settlement costs. A check to cover your closing costs will probably have to be
a cashier’s check. The title company or other entity conducting the closing
will tell you the required amount for:</SPAN>



<ul class=text>
<li>Downpayment</li>

<li>Loan origination
fees</li>

<li>Points, or loan
discount fees, you pay to receive a lower interest rate</li>

<li>Appraisal fee</li>

<li>Credit report</li>

<li>Private mortgage
insurance premium</li>

<li>Insurance escrow
for homeowners insurance, if being paid as part of the mortgage</li>

<li>Property tax
escrow, if being paid as part of the mortgage. Lenders keep funds for taxes and
insurance in escrow accounts as they are paid with the mortgage, then pay the
insurance or taxes for you.</li>

<li>Deed recording
fees</li>

<li>Title insurance
policy premiums</li>

<li>Survey</li>

<li>Inspection
fees—building inspection, termites, etc.</li>

<li>Notary fees</li>

<li>Prorations for
your share of costs, such as utility bills and property taxes</li>
</ul>

<span class=text><b>A Note About Prorations</b>: Because such costs are usually paid on either a
monthly or yearly basis, you might have to pay a bill for services used by the
sellers before they moved. Proration is a way for the sellers to pay you back
or for you to pay them for bills they may have paid in advance. For example,
the gas company usually sends a bill each month for the gas used during the
previous month. But assume you buy the home on the 6<sup>th</sup> of the month.
You would owe the gas company for only the days from the 6<sup>th</sup> to the
end for the month. The seller would owe for the first five days. The bill would
be prorated for the number of days in the month, and then each person would be
responsible for the days of his or her ownership.</SPAN>
