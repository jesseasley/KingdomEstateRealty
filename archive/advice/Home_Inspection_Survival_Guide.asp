<span class=pageheading>Home Inspection Survival Guide</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=sectionheading>Selling Your Home Involves a Lot More Than Finding the Right Buyer</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class="text">It’s like a scene from a reality television show. 
Strangers arrive at your front door and dive into every nook and cranny of your 
personal space. For hours on end they open closets, crawl through your 
belongings, turn on every faucet in the house, flush toilets, fire up your oven 
and run your washer, dryer or any other appliance they can find. Then, they 
climb your roof, wander through your basement and seemingly trounce over every 
square inch of your yard. Your challenge, as the contestant in this show, is to 
remain pleasant, cheerful and completely accommodating while these personal 
invaders tear through your home.<BR><BR>But if you survive the harrowing ordeal 
without blowing a fuse, the payoff can be big: a windfall of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from the sale of your home.<BR><BR>According to a joint 
study by the <A class="text" href="http://www.ashi.org/">American Society of Home 
Inspectors</A> (ASHI) and the <A class="text" href="http://www.realtor.org/">National 
Association of Realtors</A> (NAR), nearly four out of every five homes sold in 
the nation are evaluated by a professional home inspector before they are sold. 
Hired by the homebuyer, these inspections are designed to protect the buyers 
from investing in a home that turns out to be a real life money pit. NAR reports 
that realtors recommend buyers get a home inspection nearly 99% of the time. 
Most buyers heed that advice, requesting home inspections in 84% of all 
transactions.<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class="text">For sellers, understanding the inspection process and 
preparing your home for the inevitable evaluation not only helps to ensure that 
the transaction goes through, but can often translate into getting a top-dollar 
selling price as well.<BR><BR><B>How It Works</B><BR>Nearly all purchase 
contracts for homes sold today include an inspection contingency clause, a 
provision to allow the buyers to hire a home inspector of their choosing to 
thoroughly evaluate the home for any major problems.<BR><BR>Once the contract 
has been signed, inspections usually happen quickly. After an appointment is 
made with the seller, the home inspector arrives with buyer in tow, and goes 
through the entire house. Typically, a home inspection will take two to three 
hours and include a check of the home’s structural and mechanical condition. But 
besides the structural and mechanical inspection, inspectors may also do tests 
for radon gas, check for wood destroying insects, or perform other services 
requested by the buyer.<BR><BR>Since 1976, home inspections have been 
standardized by the nation’s leading inspector association, the American Society 
of Home Inspectors (see ashi.org). Also known as ASHI, the Society’s “Standards 
of Practice” dictate what must be inspected and how far inspectors need to go to 
report those findings.<BR><BR>According to ASHI, a basic home inspection 
includes an evaluation of 10 different areas of the home: structure, exterior, 
roofing system, plumbing system, electrical system, heating system, air 
conditioning system, interior, insulation and ventilation, and 
fireplaces.<BR><BR>Within these areas, ASHI’s Standards of Practice details what 
inspectors must look at, as well as what may be excluded, from the inspection. 
For example, when inspecting the roofing system, inspectors must evaluate the 
roof shingles, gutters, flashing, skylights, chimneys and other penetrations 
like plumbing vents. However, an inspector is not required to inspect a roof 
antenna, or to look inside chimneys that may not be readily 
accessible.<BR><BR>When the home inspection is complete, the inspector will 
issue a report to the homebuyer detailing what was found. Inspectors will report 
on problems needing immediate attention, as well as conditions that can lead to 
more serious defects down the road.<BR><BR><B>So Now What?</B><BR>What happens 
next is usually detailed in the inspection contingency clause. Typically, there 
will be additional negotiation between buyer and seller if problems are found. 
In most cases, the difference between what a buyer expected going into the 
transaction and what was actually uncovered by the inspection, defines the scope 
of what they might ask the seller to fix.<BR><BR>For example, the buyers may 
have known the roof is old, so a report detailing a roof in need of replacement 
might not raise eyebrows. However, if they expected to get through their first 
winter without buying a brand new furnace, which turns out to be needed, sellers 
can expect a request to toss one into the transaction.<BR><BR>In a best-case 
scenario, resolving these disputes is best done by sharing the expense. After 
all, the seller didn’t promise a home with a brand new furnace and the buyer 
wasn’t expecting to go 20 years without replacing the existing one. Splitting 
the cost in a case like this is a fair and reasonable way to resolve the 
issue.<BR><BR><B>Dress for Success</B> Most home sellers don’t think of 
themselves as fierce competitors in a market of high-priced products. But make 
no mistake, if your home is on the market, you are. Homes are a high-priced 
commodity and in any given city, there are hundreds from which buyers can 
choose. The best way to make certain your home attracts buyers and the highest 
possible sales price is to make sure it’s “dressed for success,” both inside and 
out.<BR><BR>A fresh coat of paint and some new landscaping may seem like obvious 
first steps in prepping your home for sale, but when it comes to the home 
inspection, there’s much more to do.<BR><BR>Start outside repairing minor things 
like loose steps, disconnected gutters and rotted trim. Look, with a critical 
eye, for anything that’s been neglected and needs repair, like a rotted 
windowsill or missing roof shingle. A pair of binoculars is a good tool to use 
for the roof review. Besides missing shingles, look for loose metal flashing 
around chimneys and plumbing vents, a common cause of leaks.<BR><BR>Inside the 
home, give your mechanical systems an honest assessment. If your heating and 
cooling system hasn’t been recently inspected and serviced, do it now. If you 
are aware of any minor plumbing or electrical repairs that need to be done, get 
them done way before the inspection takes place. Leaky toilet fill valves, 
drippy faucets or electrical outlets that don’t work might seem minor, but 
fixing them now not only means you’ll have less to worry when the inspection is 
done, it also shows both the inspector and the buyers that you’ve taken good 
care of your home.<BR><BR><B>What’s Good for the Goose, is Good for the 
Gander</B> If you can afford it, one of the smartest things you can do to get 
your home ready for sale is to hire your own home inspector to go through it 
before it goes on the market. Doing this will provide several distinct 
advantages.<BR><BR>First, it is likely to avoid “surprises,” like when the 
buyer’s inspector proclaims your electrical panel needs to be replaced. By the 
time the contract price is agreed to, most sellers have negotiated down as far 
as they want to go and the buyers have also offered up the most they want to 
spend, so finding a costly problem at this late stage can send the transaction 
into a tizzy.<BR><BR>Secondly, if problems are discovered, you have the time and 
the ability to either repair these on your own schedule or to disclose them 
upfront to the buyer, eliminating the possibility that the buyer will demand you 
make repairs later. Plus, if repairing the problem is your choice, you can do so 
without the buyer looking over your shoulder, second-guessing every decision you 
make.<BR><BR>Finally, once the buyer hires his own inspector, you’ll have a good 
baseline by which to compare the new report. While inspection reports will 
rarely match item for item, major differences are rare amongst qualified and 
experienced inspectors. Your home inspector can even become your advocate by 
looking over and dissecting the buyer’s inspector’s report.<BR><BR>To find a 
qualified inspector in your area, use the “Find an Inspector” locator on the 
ASHI web site at www.ashi.org. Inspectors listed here have met rigorous testing 
and experience requirements and are among the most qualified in the nation. By 
submitting an inquiry to an inspector through the site, your information is 
transmitted electronically in real-time, saving you time and helping you connect 
with an inspector more quickly.<BR><BR><B>Rules of the Road</B> While the home 
inspection can be both intimidating and invasive, remember that the inspector 
works for the person who hired him or her. Inspectors will only discuss their 
findings with their own customer. Therefore, the seller will most likely be the 
last one to hear about trouble in the transaction when the buyer has arranged 
for the inspection. While it may seem unfair, that’s the way it is. In fact, in 
some states that license home inspectors, they are prevented by law from 
disclosing the results of the inspection to anyone but their 
client.<BR><BR>Besides getting your home in tip-top shape for the inspection, 
the best thing you can do during the process is to disappear. Homebuyers will be 
more comfortable discussing their concerns openly with the inspector if you are 
not within earshot. And since watching the inspection process can feel akin to 
being awake during open heart surgery, being away will also keep your stress 
levels in check.<BR><BR>Whatever you do, do not follow the home inspector and 
buyer around. If there’s one thing that drives both buyer and inspector nuts, 
it’s this. Buyers often perceive such overly supervisory behavior as evidence of 
a home seller trying to hide a defect and worried about whether the jig is up. 
Home inspectors will be annoyed and, human nature being what it is, the process 
may become needlessly tense, when it should be educational.<BR><BR>For the best 
results get your home ready – then get out of the way.<BR><BR>Note: Tom

Home Inspection Offers Peek at the Inspection Process</B><BR>The experience of a 
real home inspection is just a few clicks away at ashi.org, theweb site for the 
American Society of Home Inspectors. <A class="text" href="http://www.ashi.org/">ASHI’s 
Virtual Home Inspection</A> tool takes consumers though each of 10 different 
areas ASHI inspectors must check, explaining what is looked for along the way. 
By using the tool, both home buyers and sellers can get a gain a good 
understanding of what inspectors search for, before anyone sets foot on the real 
property.<BR>
