<P align=justify><SPAN class="text">You've decided to sell your home. How long will it take? Will 
you get your asking price? What if you find a new home before your current one 
sells and you're stuck with two mortgages? These are some of the thoughts that 
may keep you up at night. But what if you could follow a 10 step plan to put all 
the odds in your favor? You can!.</P>
<P class="text" align=justify>

<b>First Impressions</b>
<P align=justify><SPAN class="text">You only have about 15 seconds to make a 
good first impression.  It's true when meeting people and it's true when selling 
your home. Your front yard and home's exterior set the tone so trim the hedges, 
cut the grass, remove the clutter and add some color! <br><br>Don't be afraid to invest a little money in 
fixing and replacing the basics. Remember that it takes money to make money, so 
before you put the sign on your lawn take time to clean up, fix up, and prepare 
for your first potential buyer. If you spend wisely on the right improvements, 
you will be rewarded with a higher sales price and a quick turnaround. </P>

<b>Simplify </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>The house is your product, not your furnishings 
and décor. Simplify each room so that the buyer sees the great features your 
home has to offer, not the family photos, your favorite collections, or anything 
that might offend, such as an overabundance of religious icons, or your fully 
stocked bar. </P>

<b>Remove Clutter</b>
<P class="text" align=justify>Nothing is more distracting than clutter. It 
will make the space feel small and claustrophobic. Buyers want to feel 
expansiveness and perceive ample space for their own belongings. This applies to 
your closets too. </P>

<b>Make it Shine </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>Wash the windows, remove spider webs, polish the 
wood, scrub the grout, clean the chandelier and create a spotless kitchen and 
bath area. It's simple to do, costs practically nothing, and is one of the best 
selling points you can create for your home. It shows you care and will give the 
impression that the rest of your home has been well maintained. </P>

<b>Bring in Light </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>A dark home can be a depressing place. Maximize 
natural light from windows by removing heavy draperies and window coverings, or 
at the very least, open them up when showing your home. If the view outside is 
not ideal, either fix or downplay it in some way. You can't hide the offending 
space forever. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>In addition to allowing natural light to shine 
in, create mood areas with accent lighting, and add task lighting to work areas. 
Avoid exclusive use of ceiling lights. They can cast shadows and detract from 
other features. </P>

<b>Freshen Up </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>The potential home buyer doesn't want a carpet 
or paint allowance. They want a home that is move-in ready. If your walls are 
dark green, purple, red or another bold color, repaint them in a neutral tone. 
Remove dated or busy wallpaper. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>If you own pets, have young children, or your 
carpeting is several years old, please replace it. Spills, pet odors, worn areas 
and grime are all big turnoffs. Your investment will be well worth it. If that's 
not possible, hire a professional carpet cleaner. Remember, your home is selling 
in a competitive market. There may be several others available in your price 
range, so make yours the one that creates a bidding war. </P>

<b>Accentuate the Positives </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>In every home there is something that makes it 
special. It could be the crown moldings, a beautiful fireplace, built-in 
bookshelves, or an open, spacious floor plan. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>You may possess beautiful views from the 
windows, ample storage, or a garage workshop. Sometimes it's just the fact that 
you live in a well kept neighborhood, a favorable school district, or on a golf 
course, that appeals to potential buyers. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>Remember what attracted you to the home in the 
first place, or ask your realtor about your home’s unique selling points. Even a 
fixer upper can be seen as an asset to a first time home buyer. </P>

<b>Downplay the Negatives </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>On the flip side, virtually every home has a 
problem or two that detracts from its desirability. You may have grown 
accustomed to them or no longer notice them. Take the time to identify the 
challenges and ask a professional about possible remedies. </P>

<b>Consult With Us </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>Because you've chosen us carefully and after 
much thought, and we are expert at home selling, listen to our advice, and work 
with us as a trusted partner in the sale of your home. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>Before you spend a bundle on home improvements, 
be sure the changes you plan to make are cost effective and don't end up 
overpricing your home in comparison to others in your neighborhood and market. 
Certain improvements are more desirable than others in the eyes of home buyers, 
so don't waste money on changes that produce low-returns. </P>

<b>Welcome The Buyer </b>
<P class="text" align=justify>It's Showtime! Your house is on the market and 
is no longer your private space. When the lockbox is attached to the door and 
the sign appears on your lawn, it's time to take on a new frame of mind. Your 
home has become a product. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>If yo've followed the suggestions of your 
realtor and implemented some of the strategies we've mentioned, all you have left 
to do is maintain cleanliness, keep it smelling fresh, well lit, and inviting. 
Be sure you leave the house when the showing takes place. Provide an open guest 
book in an obvious location so you can gauge the exposure you're receiving. </P>
<P class="text" align=justify>Offer a flyer with a photograph and statistics 
about your home, a disclosure statement, and a list of repairs and recent 
improvements you've made. Anything you can do to make your home stand out and be 
memorable will set you apart from your competition. </P>
<DIV align=justify><SPAN class="text">Good luck! May your home sell quickly, 
at or above your asking price! </SPAN></DIV>
