<DIV class=text>How the housing market looks in the coming year will 
largely depend on who is doing the looking: For many Americans, this will be a 
terrific time to buy a house, even as others struggle to hold on to their homes, 
and thousands -- perhaps hundreds of thousands -- succumb to 
foreclosure.<BR><BR></DIV>

<DIV class="text">Sellers will have a tougher time closing a deal and may 
have to settle for less as prices around the country stagnate or slide. 
Mortgages will be tougher to come by. And builders -- already competing with a 
fat inventory of existing homes -- will see demand for their wares further 
erode.<BR><BR>No wonder, then, that less than two years after the nation found 
itself in the grip of a house-buying frenzy characterized by sky-high demand and 
bounding prices, the industry’s exuberance has given way to unease.<BR><BR>"I’ve 
been in the business for 26 years, and there's more inventory now than I’ve ever 
seen," says Richard O’Brien, a real estate broker in Youngstown, Ohio -- one of 
a slew of Midwestern cities where home supply is outpacing demand. "Every day, 
25 or 30 houses go on the market. Only three or four sell."<BR><BR></DIV>

<DIV class="text">Nationally, "the market is the weakest it has been in 
17 years," says Scott Anderson, a senior economist for Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 
one of the nation’s largest home lenders. “Hang on to your seats," he adds. 
"It's going to be an interesting ride."<BR><BR>A good piece of the current slump 
was just inevitable: Most experts had predicted that the spectacular run-up in 
home prices from 2003 to 2005 simply couldn't last -- and, in some places, had 
soared well beyond the reach of most buyers and common sense.<BR><BR>The 
superheated markets of those years -- Las Vegas, Phoenix and much of California, 
for example -- are now nosing into corrections. Saddled with a condo glut, some 
Florida cities, especially on the coast, are tough places to sell. Ohio, Indiana 
and Michigan, suffering industrial woes that have spelled widespread job loss, 
also will see home prices shrink.<BR><BR>Buyers most often will have the upper 
hand elsewhere too, says David Lereah, chief economist for the National 
Association of Realtors. The typical American home will linger longer on the 
market -- how much longer will vary by location -- and already flat prices are 
likely to slip.<BR><BR>Mind you, real estate is local, and parts of the country 
will actually see appreciation -- a fact that is masked by gloomy national 
statistics. Sales and prices are robust in much of Texas, Lereah points out. 
And, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, a 
mini-boom saw house prices play catch-up in Utah, Wyoming and the Pacific 
Northwest last year.<BR><BR>Whether the rest of the housing industry reverses 
its cool-down depends, to a large degree, on the now-familiar woes of sub-prime 
lenders, who in recent years doled out millions of dollars to buyers lacking the 
income or credit for traditional mortgages. These loans have made home ownership 
a reality for Americans who'd otherwise be renting, but they also have proved 
dear. Adjusting interest rates have jacked up the monthly bills of 
already-strapped borrowers. Interest-only payments and 100-percent financing 
have left a legion of these home owners without a penny of equity.<BR><BR>"When 
you have the cost-of-living increases we’ve seen -- gas prices going up, utility 
prices going up, credit-card debt -- an adjustment in your mortgage of 200, 400, 
500 bucks more a month is going to give you problems,” says George Roddy, who 
runs seminars on real estate investing and a foreclosure-listing service in 
Addison, Tex.<BR><BR>A December report by the nonprofit Center for Responsible 
Lending, a watchdog group, estimates that almost one in five sub-prime loans 
made in recent years has ended or will end in foreclosure, putting some 2.2 
million families out of their homes and costing them $164 billion in lost 
wealth. That scenario is lent credence by the 1.2 million mortgage accounts that 
went bad last year -- a 42 percent increase over 2005.<BR><BR>"In this 
environment, maybe 20 percent of households have the wrong kind of loan," says 
Kenneth Rosen, a professor of real estate and urban economics at the University 
of California, Berkeley. "This doesn’t end well."<BR><BR>Part of the blame for 
this situation lies with overzealous -- and, in certain cases, predatory -- 
lenders. "There was some incredibly irresponsible lending," Lereah cites, 
describing it as "trying to get more water from the sponge." But without 
question, some buyers failed themselves by asking too few questions, seeking too 
much house or waiting too long to seek out help.<BR><BR>Whatever the case, 
default on so large a scale is bound to produce aftershocks nationwide. Among 
the first: Lenders are tightening their standards by requiring higher credit 
scores, lower loan amounts and bigger down payments. This means not only that 
many buyers won’t qualify for new loans but also that home owners already 
saddled with sub-prime mortgages will have a tough time refinancing to better 
terms -- and may be driven to hand over the house keys.<BR><BR>With fewer 
qualified buyers on the scene, an already-fat housing inventory will take longer 
to slim down, Lereah says. How much longer? Months, he suggests. Years, Rosen 
worries.<BR><BR>In the meantime, foreclosed homes entering the market will 
exacerbate the problem and further depress prices. That, in turn, may idle a 
home construction industry already short of work: In January, private-sector 
housing starts were down nearly 38 percent from a year before.<BR><BR>If anyone 
stands to gain from the mess, it’s buyers with good credit, who should be able 
to navigate the lending straits without hassle, find plenty of inventory to 
choose from and have the luxury of time to mull their purchases.<BR><BR>"You'll 
certainly be able to negotiate -- especially with the home-building industry, if 
you're buying a new house," Rosen says. "You'll probably be able to get a really 
good deal in the next year."<BR>
