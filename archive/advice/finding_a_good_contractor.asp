Dan Cord and Craig Nelson wanted to remodel a Victorian they had 
purchased for a steal in San Francisco. They started looking for contractors by 
calling Yellow Page ads and asking friends, their Realtor and a neighbor who had 
similar work done. After settling on 10 possibilities, they set up one day for 
interviews. "When the big interview day came," says Craig, "only three showed 
up! That took care of some of the decision-making right there." <br><br>The couple had a $50,000 
budget and was meticulous in every possible contracting detail. They had worked 
on a few homes before and were quite experienced with the process. The start 
date, ending date, who would get the permits and what materials the contactor 
was to provide were standard items in the contract. They also negotiated 
expenses and labor costs to the penny with no room for changes or mistakes. "The 
job was completed on time and under budget, with no cost surprises," says Dan.

<span class=sectionheading>Friendly Referrals Are 
Not Always the Answer </span><BR><BR><span class=text>
Dan and Craig were so happy, they referred the contractor to a friend who 
tells a much different story about the same contractor. "It started out okay," 
says Bill Burns, a retired professional. "But there was a lot of discomfort 
along the way. The contractor came out and made complex suggestions that would 
have made my $10,000 budget balloon to about $25,000," says Burns. "The job 
dragged along, with missed deadlines, misunderstandings and in the end the guy 
handed me a bill for an extra $1,100 saying the remodel on the closet cost more 
than he expected." <BR><BR>Burns, like many first-time 
remodelers, didn't have the experience, energy or the chutzpah to demand the 
same spell-it-out-in-every-last-detail contract. Moreover, Burn's job was 
significantly smaller than Dan and Craig's, with most of the expense in low mark 
up materials with only a modest sum in labor. "I always felt like he just wasn't 
interested," recalls Burns, "because the money wasn't there." Burns was wise to 
take a referral but not that one. He could have saved himself a lot of headaches 
by doing a bit more research before hiring the first contractor to come along.

<span class=sectionheading>Searching Right the First 
Time </span><BR><BR><span class=text>Start by 
making mental notes of the improvements and follow up with a worksheet that 
details your needs and budget. Be certain to highlight any item that may cost 
extra or be a special problem for you or your contractor. <BR><BR>Try to accumulate a large 
referral list. Start with online referrals, the local phone book and by asking 
experienced friends or those who have had work on a similar budget. When you 
have a top ten, call the Better Business Bureau or local consumer agencies and 
check with the state licensing board to see their standing. This will narrow the 
choices. Then call your top three and proceed with prepared questions:</span><P>
<UL class=text>
<LI>Have you done any jobs like 
mine recently?
<LI>Is this a budget you are 
used to working with? 
<LI>Do you want this job? 

<LI>Will it cost less or be 
easier if I pick up the materials? (Small jobs) 
<LI>Do you give written 
warranties? 
<LI>Will this job require a 
permit? 
<LI>My budget is $5,000. Can I 
get what I want for that amount of money? </LI></UL>

<span class=sectionheading>Red Flags: Some Early 
Warning Signs</span>
<BR><BR>
<ul class=text><LI>Doesn't have a contractor's 
license to show you or a license number on the business card
<LI>Had to call more than once 
to set up the appointment<BR>
<LI>Doesn't show up and calls 
you late to reschedule<BR>
<LI>Says he is very busy but 
you will be worked in<BR>
<LI>Says he only does big jobs 
but will try just for you<BR>
<LI>Seems unfamiliar with what 
you are talking about or dismisses your point of view<BR>
<LI>Starts puffing up the job 
needs right away<BR>
<LI>Seems slick - you are 
uncomfortable or you have a bad feeling<BR>
<LI>Offers no physical 
address<BR>
<LI>Does not offer referrals of 
satisfied customers<BR>
<LI>Says you don't need a 
contract – likes to work informally<BR>
<LI>Can't quote actual costs 
and says he will work hourly until the job is done<BR>
<LI>Says you don't need permits 
– this is usually nonsense </LI></ul>


<P class=text>>Take your time making up 
your mind. Don't be swayed by fancy chat or good looks. Don't get personally 
involved or let your emotions take over. You will be very unhappy for a long 
time with a poor choice and in the end, you will pay the bills. So a good 
decision now will give you peace of mind and that is worth a fortune.
