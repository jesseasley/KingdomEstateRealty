<span class=pageheading>FSBOs: 6 Forms You’ll Need to Sell
Your Home</span><br><br>



<ol class=text>
 <li><b>Property
     Disclosure Form</b>. This form requires you to reveal all known defects to
     your property. Check with your state government to see if there is a
     special form required in your state.</li>
 <li><b>Purchasers
     Access to Premises Agreement.</b> This agreement sets conditions for
     permitting the buyer to enter your home for activities such as measuring
     for draperies before you move.</li>
 <li><b>Sales
     Contract</b>. The agreement between you and the seller on terms and
     conditions of sale. Again, check with your state real estate department to
     see if there is a required form.</li>
 <li><b>Sales
     Contract Contingency Clauses</b>. In addition to the contract, you may
     need to add one or more attachments to the contract to address special
     contingencies—such as the buyer’s need to sell a home before purchasing
     yours.</li>
 <li><b>Pre-
     and Post-Occupancy Agreements.</b> Unless you’re planning on moving out
     and the buyer moving in on the day of closing, you’ll need an agreement on
     the terms and costs of occupancy once the sale closes.</li>
 <li><b>Lead-Based
     Paint Disclosure Pamphlet</b>. If your home was built before 1978, you
     must provide the pamphlet to all sellers. You also must have buyers sign a
     statement indicating they received the pamphlet.</li>
