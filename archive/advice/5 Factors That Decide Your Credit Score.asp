<span class=pageheading>5 Factors That Decide Your Credit
Score</span>


<p class="text">Credit scores range between 200 and 800. Scores above 620
are considered desirable for obtaining a mortgage. These factors will affect
your score.</p>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Your
     payment history. Whether you paid credit card obligations on time.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How
     much you owe. Owing a great deal of money on numerous accounts can indicate
     that you are overextended.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>The
     length of your credit history. In general, the longer the better.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How
     much new credit you have. New credit, either installment payments or new
     credit cards, are considered more risky, even if you pay promptly.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>The
     types of credit you use. Generally, it’s desirable to have more than one
     type of credit—installment loans, credit cards, and a mortgage, for
     example.</li>
</ol>
