<span class=pageheading>8 Steps to Getting Your Finances in Order</span><br><br>

<ol class=text>
 <li><b>Develop
     a family budget</b>. Instead of budgeting what you’d like to spend, use
     receipts to create a budget for what you actually spent over the last six
     months. One advantage of this approach is that it factors in unexpected
     expenses, such as car repairs, illnesses, etc., as well as predictable
     costs such as rent.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Reduce
     your debt</b>. Generally speaking, lenders look for a total debt load of
     no more than 36 percent of income. Since this figure includes your
     mortgage, which typically ranges between 25 percent and 28 percent of
     income, you need to get the rest of installment debt—car loans, student
     loans, revolving balances on credit cards—down to between 8 percent and 10
     percent of your total income.</li>
</ol>

 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Get
     a handle on expenses</b>. You probably know how much you spend on rent and
     utilities, but little expenses add up. Try writing down <i>everything</i>
     you spend for one month. You’ll probably see some great ways to save.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Increase
     your income</b>. It may be necessary to take on a second, part-time job to
     get your income at a high-enough level to qualify for the home you want.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Save
     for a downpayment</b>. Although it’s possible to get a mortgage with only
     5 percent down—or even less in some cases—you can usually get a better
     rate and a lower overall cost if you put down more. Shoot for saving a 20
     percent downpayment.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Create
     a house fund</b>. Don’t just plan on saving whatever’s left toward a
     downpayment. Instead decide on a certain amount a month you want to save,
     then put it away as you pay your monthly bills.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=7 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Keep
     your job</b>. While you don’t need to be in the same job forever to
     qualify, having a job for less than two years may mean you have to pay a
     higher interest rate.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=8 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Establish
     a good credit history</b>. Get a credit card and make payments by the due
     date. Do the same for all your other bills. Pay off the entire balance
     promptly.</li>
</ol>
