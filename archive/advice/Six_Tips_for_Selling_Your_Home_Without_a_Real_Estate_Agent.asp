<span class=pageheading>Six Tips for Selling Your Home Without a Real Estate Agent</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class="text">With all the online real estate information available 
to home sellers nowadays, it's not surprising that some of them consider selling 
without the help of a real estate agent.<BR><BR>The biggest advantage of the 
for-sale-by-owner strategy is that a commission won't need to be paid to a 
listing agent. But those taking on the job themselves need to roll up their 
sleeves and prepare for a little work to get the home sold, understanding that 
they will be the ones taking care of tasks ranging from marketing to showing the 
property to interested buyers.<BR><BR>Those interested in trying their hand at 
selling a house might also consider the following tips:<BR><BR><B>1. Prepare the 
House</B><BR><BR>Before doing anything, make sure that the house is in good 
shape to show, said Piper Nichole, author of 'The For Sale By Owner Handbook.' 
That means making sure it is clean, decluttered, odor-free, brightly lit and 
freshly painted. Curb appeal is also important. See what projects to consider 
before selling.<BR><BR>She also advises thinking about offering buyer incentives 
such as flexible move-in arrangements, help with closing costs or providing a 
home warranty.<BR><BR><B>2. Price It Correctly </B><BR><BR>"The biggest mistake 
for sale by owners make is pricing their home too high," Nichole said in an 
e-mail interview. If the home subsequently ends up sitting too long on the 
market and the asking price is lower, a potential buyer might speculate that 
something is wrong with the property, she said.<BR><BR>Use Web sites such as 
Zillow.com and HouseValues.com to get a starting idea of what a house is worth, 
said Colby Sambrotto, chief operating officer of ForSaleByOwner.com. A look at a 
listings site, such as Realtor.com, will reveal what sellers are asking for in 
the neighborhood, he added.<BR><BR>Nichole also advises asking at least three 
agents for a free comparative market analysis before setting an asking price -- 
as long as you're prepared to hear their pitches on why you should enlist their 
help to sell the home. But Sambrotto cautions a seller not to be disingenuous to 
a real estate agent, and to bring one in only if he or she is considering hiring 
an agent to help in the process.<BR><BR>Finally, go to neighborhood open houses 
to see what other homes are selling for. If the home is unique and difficult to 
compare to others, consider having it appraised, Nichole said.<BR><BR><B>3. 
Decide How to Use the Commission Savings</B><BR><BR>Sellers also need to ask 
themselves if they want to use all or part of the commission they would 
otherwise pay in order to discount the property, said Steve Udelson, CEO of 
Owners.com. The alternative -- extracting as much profit from the home as 
possible -- is attractive at first blush, but often isn't the most efficient way 
to price a home.<BR><BR>Translation: Those opting not to discount should 
probably brace for a longer time on the market, Udelson said.<BR><BR>"Probably 
the best route for most people is an in-between approach -- use part of the 
savings to attract a buyer faster and part of the savings as added profit," he 
said. The biggest mistake that sellers will make is trying to get top dollar for 
the property as well as a fast sale, he said.<BR><BR><B>4. Market It 
Correctly</B><BR><BR>The Internet can be a big help in marketing a property. 
Sites ForSaleByOwner.com and Owners.com, for example, allow a seller to post a 
listing to gain Internet exposure.<BR><BR>Other online options include community 
marketplaces such as Craigslist.org and portals such as Yahoo. When placing a 
newspaper ad, also make sure to ask if it will be posted online for free, 
Nichole said.<BR><BR>But don't underestimate the power of a sign, she added. 
Directional signs can call attention to a home from nearby roadways, and signs 
in front of the home should have an information tube or box filled with 
informational flyers. Just make sure you're clear on area sign laws.<BR><BR>And 
consider listing on the Multiple Listing Service as well, she added.<BR><BR>"The 
MLS sells more homes than any other method," Nichole said. "If a buyer's agent 
finds a buyer for your home, you would only pay one commission."<BR><BR><B>5. 
Get Support Lined Up</B><BR><BR>Decide early on whose services to use for the 
paperwork, Sambrotto said. That means either finding a title company or a real 
estate attorney to assist in completing the sale.<BR><BR>When interviewing 
professionals, a seller might want to ask whether they have worked with 
for-sale-by-owner clients before, and how many of those clients they've had in 
the past month, Udelson said. "Pick the one that's most enthusiastic," he 
said.<BR><BR><B>6. Make Sure a Buyer Can Afford It</B><BR><BR>"When it does come 
time to deal with a buyer, it's a good idea to have a written preapproval," 
Udelson said. Working with a buyer who is preapproved for a mortgage will remove 
some potential surprises from the closing process.<BR><BR>Nichole said that one 
of the most common problems that a for sale by owner will run into is getting to 
closing only to find out that the buyer couldn't afford the house -- "causing 
them to start the selling process all over again."<BR>
