<span class=pageheading>14 ways to make the most of your curb appeal</span><br><br>
<P class="text">Curb appeal is the equivalent of charisma in a 
home.</p>
<P class="text">It's that quality that makes you say "wow" when you first see it. 
You feel good when you pull into the driveway. You want to walk in the front 
door. Whether the home is yours or one you're considering, curb appeal can make 
a big difference in how you feel about the property.</P>
<P class="text">If your home has that star quality, you won't have any trouble 
getting more for it than similar homes in the neighborhood. It also means you 
won't have any trouble getting potential buyers into the home.</P>
<P class="text">It works the other way, too. "A lot of people won't go into a 
house if it looks bad from the outside," says Tom Silva, general contractor on 
the PBS series "This Old House" and "Ask This Old House." "Curb appeal is the 
beginning of getting people to look at the inside."</P>
<P class="text">If your home doesn't shine, there are plenty of things you can do 
to unleash its charm.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=1 name=1></A><SPAN class="text">1. Manicure the yard. 
</SPAN>Some of the prime elements: Nurture and mow the lawn so it's trimmed and 
healthy. Make sure plant beds "are edged with nice, crisp edges, and mulched," 
says Roger Cook, landscape contractor for "This Old House" and "Ask This Old 
House." "It makes everything stand out. It gives the feeling that if the outside 
is being taken care of, maybe the inside is, too."</P>
<P class="text"><A id=2 name=2></A><SPAN class="text">2. Clean the windows, doors 
and front entryway. </SPAN>Get rid of those spider webs on the light fixtures, 
shine any metal work and change all the bulbs. Visitors will notice whether the 
front of the home looks clean, even if it's on an unconscious level. And if 
everything is shined and bright, it's not only inviting but it signals that the 
rest of the home is well maintained.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=3 name=3></A><SPAN class="text">3. Scope out the front door. 
</SPAN>It's one of the first things people will notice in a home, so make it 
count. But that doesn't mean you have to break the bank because there are good 
options at every price level. You can paint it for the cost of your time and a 
little paint or have it professionally replaced for $1,000 or more.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=4 name=4></A><SPAN class="text">4. Don't skimp on flowers. 
</SPAN>"It's always nice to have flowers in front of the house," says Cook, 
whether it's hanging baskets, beds of annuals or both. "And, for some reason, 
people like red flowers better than anything else," he says.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=5 name=5></A><SPAN class="text">5. Pressure clean. </SPAN>It 
can give a new appearance to walkways, driveways and (depending on the 
construction of your home) sometimes the house itself, says Cook. You can even 
rent the machinery and do it yourself.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=6 name=6></A><SPAN class="text">6. Talk to your friends. 
</SPAN>"Get a fresh eye," says Silva. "You don't see something starting to look 
old or run-down because you see it so gradually." Bring in a couple of people 
you trust and ask their opinions.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=7 name=7></A><SPAN class="text">7. Head for the trees. 
</SPAN>"Trees, planted in the proper spaces," can enhance the appeal and value 
of a home, says Cook. Consult a professional to help you select the variety, 
size and location. And if you want to plant larger trees, have them 
professionally installed.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=8 name=8></A><SPAN class="text">8. Paint your house. 
</SPAN>If you want to really amp up that curb appeal, "painting your house makes 
a difference," says Silva. Use colors that are appropriate for the style of your 
house. For instance, in historical buildings, that often means soft colors and 
warm colors, he says. "You want to have a color that's warm and inviting," he 
says. "It's one of the easiest ways to get curb appeal."</P>
<P class="text"><A id=9 name=9></A><SPAN class="text">9. Call an arborist. 
</SPAN>Get the low-hanging branches -- especially those hanging over the house 
-- removed, says Cook. And that's an area where you do want to use a pro. If 
you're ever hiring anyone to work on your home, Cook says, get several free 
estimates. Don't automatically choose the cheapest one. Instead, select the one 
in whom you have the most confidence. And verify that your choice has liability 
and workman's comp insurance. (Ask to see the certificate.)</P>
<P class="text"><A id=10 name=10></A><SPAN class="text">10. Reseal the driveway. 
</SPAN>Do it yourself in a weekend or hire a pro, says Cook. For a pro, the best 
thing you can get is a recommendation from someone who's had the work done 
fairly recently, he says. If you do it yourself, wash down the driveway one day 
and let it dry. Then seal it the next day. If it has cracks that you need to 
seal, allow an extra day for the job.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=11 name=11></A><SPAN class="text">11. Examine the shutters. 
</SPAN>Many times they're the wrong size and most people hang them upside down 
or put them too far away from the windows, Silva says. What that does is throw 
off the proportion of the house.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=12 name=12></A><SPAN class="text">12. Look for elements that 
draw too much attention from the rest of the house.</SPAN> One example is the 
garage door. "A garage door should blend in. It shouldn't stand out and be the 
whole focus of the garage," says Silva. "You don't want it to dominate."</P>
<P class="text"><A id=13 name=13></A><SPAN class="text">13. Hire a professional 
designer. </SPAN>If the front of your home needs a little cosmetic work, that's 
a good time to call in a designer, says Silva. You might want to change the 
porch or add a new type of railing, or select a different style or number of 
columns. A designer is also a good option if you sense there's something out of 
whack with the way the front of the home looks, but you can't quite put your 
finger on it. Prices vary. A designer can give you options, a plan and a 
budget.</P>
<P class="text"><A id=14 name=14></A><SPAN class="text">14. Make a plan. </SPAN>If 
your landscaping lacks luster, sometimes it's a matter of moving things around, 
says Cook. One good move: If you're going to stay in the house, consult a 
professional to give you a long-range landscaping master plan, says Cook. "You 
can pick little things and keep working and after four to five years, you're 
done," he says.</P>
