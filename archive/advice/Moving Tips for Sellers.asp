<span class=pageheading>Moving Tips for Sellers</span><br><br>

<ol class=text>
<li>Give your forwarding address to the post office,
usually two to four weeks ahead of the move.</li>

<li>Notify your credit card companies, magazine
subscriptions, and bank of the change of address.</li>

<li>Develop a list of friends, relatives, and business
colleagues who need to be notified of the move.</li>

<li>Arrange to have utilities disconnected at your old
home and connected at your new one.</li>

<li>Cancel the newspaper.</li>

<li>Check insurance coverage for moved items. Usually
movers only cover what they pack.</li>

<li>Clean out appliances and prepare them for moving, if
applicable.</li>

<li>Note the weight of the goods you’ll have moved, since
long-distance moves are usually billed according to weight. Watch for movers
that use excessive padding to add weight.</li>

<li>Check with your condo or co-op about restrictions on
using the elevator or particular exits.</li>

<li>Have a “first open” box with the things you’ll need
most—toilet paper, soap, trash bags, scissors, hammer, screwdriver, pencils and
paper, cups and plates, water, snacks, and toothpaste.</li>

</ol><span class=pageheading>Plus, if you’re moving out of town:</span><br><br>

<ol class=text>
<li>Get copies of medical and dental records and
prescriptions for your family and your pets.</li>

<li>Get copies of children’s school records for transfer.</li>

<li>Ask friends for introductions to anyone they know in
your new neighborhood.</li>

<li>Consider special car needs for pets when traveling.</li>

<li>Let a friend or relative know your route.</li>

<li>Carry traveler’s checks or an ATM card for ready cash
until you can open a bank account.</li>

<li>Empty your safety deposit box.</li>

<li>Put plants in boxes with holes for air circulation if
you’re moving in cold weather.</li>
