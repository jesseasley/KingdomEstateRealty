<span class=pageheading>Offering Price -- Key Factors</span><br><br>
<DIV class=bbarticleBody>
<DIV class=text><BR><B>How 
Property Condition Affects Your Offer</B><BR><BR>Since you have toured the 
property you are interested in, you should know how it compares to the general 
neighborhood. All you have to do is put the home in one of three categories 
--average, above average, or below average.<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class=text>When evaluating a home’s condition, there are a number 
of things you should consider. Structural condition is most important -- items 
such as walls, ceilings, floors, doors and windows. Then paint, carpets, and 
floor coverings. Pay special attention to bathrooms and bedrooms and whether the 
plumbing and electricity work efficiently. Look at the fixtures, such as light 
switches, doorknobs, and drawer handles. The front and backyards should be in 
reasonably good shape.<BR><BR>The missing ingredient will be information on the 
condition of the homes from your comparable sales list. Provided you chose the 
right agent to represent you, they will have actually visited most of those 
homes and be able to provide key insights.<BR><BR><B>How Home Improvements 
Affect Your Offer Price</B><BR><BR>Even when comparing exact model matches 
within a tract of homes, you should note whether the previous owners have made 
any substantial improvements. Cosmetic changes should be largely ignored, but 
major improvements should be taken into account. Most important would be room 
additions, especially bedrooms and bathrooms. Other items, like expensive floor 
tile or swimming pools should be taken into account, too, but should be 
discounted. A pool that costs $20,000 to install does not normally add $20,000 
in value to the home.<BR><BR>Rely on your agent to give you guidance in this 
area.<BR><BR><B>How Market Conditions Affect Your Offer Price</B><BR><BR>A hot 
market is a "seller’s market." During a seller’s market, properties can sell 
within a few days of being listed and there are often multiple offers. Sometimes 
homes even sell above the asking price. Though most buyer’s want to get a "deal" 
on a home, reducing your offer by even a few thousand dollars could mean that 
someone else will get the home you desire.<BR><BR>A slow market is a "buyer’s 
market. During a buyer’s market properties may languish on the market for some 
time and offers may be few and far between. Prices may even decline temporarily. 
Such a market would allow you to be more flexible in offering a lower price for 
the home. Even if your offered price is too low, the seller is likely to make 
some sort of counter-offer and you can begin negotiations in 
earnest.<BR><BR>More often than not, the market is simply "steady," or in 
transition. When a market is steady, no real rules apply on whether you should 
make an offer on the high end of your range or the low end. You could find 
yourself in a situation with multiple offers on your desired house, or where no 
one has made an offer in weeks.<BR><BR>Transition markets are more difficult to 
define. If the economy slows unexpectedly, as it did in the early nineties, 
people who buy on the high end of a seller’s market (like the late eighties) 
could find their home loses value for several years. So far, no one has proven 
reliable in predicting when markets change or how good or bad the real estate 
market will become.<BR><BR><B>How Seller Motivation Affects Your Offer 
Price</B><BR><BR>Truthfully, it is rather rare that a seller’s motivation will 
dramatically affect the price of a home, but it is often possible to save a few 
thousand dollars. The most common "motivated seller" is someone who has already 
bought his or her next home or is relocating to a new area. They will be under 
the gun to sell the home quickly or face the prospect of making two mortgage 
payments at the same time. Since that can drain a bank account quickly, most 
sellers want to avoid such a situation and may be willing to give up a few 
thousand dollars to avoid the possibility.<BR><BR>There are also family crises 
that can motivate a seller to make a quick deal. However, when you see a real 
estate ad that mentions "divorce," "motivated seller," "relocation," or 
something to that affect, beware. Although the facts may be true, that does not 
necessarily mean the seller is motivated to make a quick and costly sale. Most 
likely, the ad is more designed to generate phone calls and leads rather than 
sell the home.<BR><BR>However, there are times when a seller is truly 
distressed, willing to make a quick sale and sacrifice thousands of dollars. 
With the seller’s permission, the listing agent will post this information along 
with the listing in the Multiple Listing Service. They may also inform other 
agents during office and association marketing sessions or by flyers sent to 
other real estate offices. Provided this information has been made generally 
available to Realtors, your agent should know when a seller is truly motivated 
and when it is just "puff" designed to elicit interest in a property.<BR><BR>The 
exception is when an agent is selling a home they have listed themselves or 
selling a home that was listed by another agent from their own company. In such 
a situation, the agent may be acting as an agent for the seller, or as a "dual 
agent," representing both you and the seller. In such a situation, they cannot 
legally provide you with information that would give you an advantage over the 
seller.<BR><BR><B>The Final Decision on Your Offer Price</B><BR><BR>Comparable 
sales information helps you to determine a base price range for a particular 
home. Adding in the various factors like property condition, improvements, 
market conditions, and seller motivation help determine whether a "fair" price 
would be at the upper limit of that range or the lower limit. Perhaps you will 
feel a fair price is outside of that price range.<BR><BR>The "fair" price should 
be approximately what you are willing to agree on at the end of negotiations 
with the seller. The price you put in your offer to begin negotiations is 
totally up to you and depends on your negotiating style. Most buyers start off 
somewhat lower than the price they eventually want to pay.<BR><BR>Although your 
agent may provide advice and guidance, you are the one who makes the decision. 
The price you put in the offer is totally up to you.<BR>
