 <li>Give every room in the house a thorough cleaning
     and remove all clutter. Hiring a cleaning service may pay for itself by
     adding to a buyer’s perceived value of your home.</li>
 <li>For a sleeker, more spacious look, consider
     placing furniture from crowded rooms in storage.</li>
 <li>Clear kitchen counters of everything other than
     perhaps a few pretty items. Ask yourself: In a model home, would a
     professional decorator put your choice of items out on the counter?</li>
 <li>Remember, closets will be opened! Keep closets,
     cupboards, and even your attic orderly and neat.<span

     consider holding a garage sale or boxing and storing unused belongings.</li>
 <li>If necessary, repaint or clean/replace dingy,
     soiled or strongly colored walls, and window and floor coverings with a

 <li>Repair dripping faucets, burned out light bulbs,
     or cracked windowpanes.</li>
 <li>Repair cracks, holes or damage to plaster,
     wallboard, wallpaper, and tiles.</li>
