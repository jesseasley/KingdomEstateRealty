<span class=pageheading>5 Things to Do Before You Sell</span><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li>Get estimates from a reliable repairperson on items
that need to be replaced soon, such as a roof or worn carpeting, for example.
In this way, buyers will have a better sense of how much these needed repairs
will affect their costs.</li>

<li>Have a termite inspection to prove to buyers that the
property is not infested.</li>

<li>Get a pre-sale home inspection so you’ll be able to
make repairs before buyers become concerned and cancel a contract.</li>

<li>Gather together warranties and guarantees on the
furnace, appliances, and other items that will remain with the house.</li>

<li>Fill out a disclosure form provided by your sales
associate. Take the time to be sure that you don’t forget problems, however
minor, that might create liability for you after the sale.</li>
</ol>
