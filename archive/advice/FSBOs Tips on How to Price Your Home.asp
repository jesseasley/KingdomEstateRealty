<span class=pageheading>FSBOs: Tips on How to Price Your
Home</span><br><br>

<ul class="text">

<li><b>Consider
     comparables</b>. What have other homes in your neighborhood sold for
     recently? How do they compare to yours in terms of size, upkeep, and
     amenities?</li>

<li><b>Consider
     competition</b>. How many other houses are for sale in your area? Are you
     competing against new homes?</li>

<li><b>Consider
     your contingencies</b>. Do you have special concerns that would affect the
     price you’ll receive? For example, do you want to be able to move in four
     months?</li>

<li><b>Get
     an appraisal</b>. For a few hundred dollars, a qualified appraiser can
     give you an estimate of your home’s value. Be sure to ask for a
     market-value appraisal. To locate appraisers in your area, contact The Appraisal
     Institute (<a class="text" href="http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/" target="_empty">www.AppraisalInstitute.org</a>)
     or ask a REALTOR for some
     recommendations.</li>

<li><b>Ask
     a lender</b>. Since most buyers will need a mortgage, it’s important that
     a home’s sale price be in line with a lender’s estimate of its value.</li>

<li><b>Be
     accurate</b>. Studies show that homes priced higher than 3 percent over
     the correct price take longer to sell.</li>

<li><b>Know
     what you’ll accept</b>. It’s critical to know what price you’ll accept
     before beginning a negotiation with a buyer.</li>
</ul>
