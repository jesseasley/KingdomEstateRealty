<span class=pageheading>SHOPPING FOR HOME PLANS</span><br><br>
<span class=sectionheading>Know what to look for as you build toward the reality of your dream 
home</span><br><br>
<DIV class=text>Building a home from scratch can be an exciting but 
daunting endeavor, not to mention fraught with hidden expenses. It all begins 
with a plan, of course, determined by your lifestyle, aesthetic preferences, the 
features of the building site and your budget. If a pricey custom house plan is 
a little beyond your reach, fear not-you can get close-to-custom by shopping 
readymade home plans. A variety of books, magazines and online retailers offer 
thousands of plan styles and options, which is great news but also a possible 
detour back to an overwhelmed state.<BR><BR>But before you bury yourself in 
blueprints, take these steps to ensure a smooth and smart shopping 
experience:<BR><BR>Before you shop<BR>• Start with the land, not the house plan. 
Knowing the requirements of your lot is critical to selecting a home design 
that’s a good match in terms of siting and grading. The weather patterns in your 
area will also have an impact on the roof slope and other exterior styling you 
select.<BR>• Carefully consider what you and your family need in a new living 
space, not only today but for the duration of your stay in the home. Traffic 
patterns may stay reasonably the same, but the number and ages of family members 
living in the home will change over time. Access, mobility and future 
flexibility of the floor plan should all be on your mind (i.e., a two-story home 
might work well now, but could be inconvenient for older residents later 
on).<BR>• Distinguish must-have features, fixtures and spaces from those that 
would simply be nice or fun to have, and plan your investment accordingly. 
Outdoor spaces for recreation and relaxation should also be considered within 
the lot lines.<BR>• Figure out what home size you can afford. A helpful tool for 
making this calculation is The National Association of Home Builders’ matrix of 
average costs per square foot for new homes by U.S. region, which you can find 
at <A class=text href="http://www.nahb.org/">http://www.nahb.org/</A>. Just multiply the 
square footage you’d like by the corresponding cost in this table, and you’ll be 
on your way to a building budget.<BR>• Take note of the home styles in your 
future neighborhood, and confirm any restrictions on size, style and municipal 
services with your local zoning board. You’ll be submitting your home site plan 
to them before building the new structure, and if you haven’t done your homework 
early on, you could find yourself in a “no fit, no build” situation right before 
construction is scheduled to begin.<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class=text >As you browse<BR>• Whether or not you plan to buy plans 
online, check out some of the Internet-based retailers’ sites to get into the 
swing of home plan selection. <A class=text 
href="http://www.houseplans.com/">HousePlans.com</A>, among others, offers 
detailed interactive search tools and a variety of plan views (floor plans, 
artist’s renderings and even occasional virtual tours) that can help you narrow 
down your interests and form realistic expectations for the final product.<BR>• 
Be open-minded. The perfect house plan doesn’t exist, so don’t turn your nose up 
at possibilities that have most of what you want. You can always use spaces in a 
different way than originally designated in the plan (e.g., a bedroom can become 
an office and vice versa), and purchased home plans can also be altered inside 
and out with the help of a professional architect.<BR>• On the other hand, 
before falling absolutely in love with a plan, take a good, hard look at its 
potential traffic flow, the materials used, efficient use of space, amount of 
storage, and convenience of work areas. The floor plan should be your first 
concern, and the façade your second.<BR>• Readymade house plans have been around 
for nearly a century, and revived interest in early styles has led to an array 
of resources that can serve as inspiration. Bungalow fans, for example, can pick 
up reproductions of original plan catalogs and books on their history and 
design.<BR>• Remember that if you do decide to alter a purchased home plan, 
you’ll be changing the square footage and potential cost of your new home, as 
well as adding fees for the pro who makes your custom adjustments (whether 
they’re employed by the company you buy plans from or an independent architect 
you’ve contracted).<BR><BR><BR>Making a purchase<BR>• Expect to pay anywhere 
from $400 to $1,300 for a full set of home plans. Since you aren’t the only one 
who will need a copy, you’ll either be purchasing one reproducible master set or 
up to eight nonreproducible sets for distribution to contractors, trades people 
and lenders.<BR>• If you’re not absolutely sure of your plan selection, it’s 
sometimes possible to purchase only the floor plan for further review before 
investing in the full set of plans.<BR>• Don’t stop at the plan when calculating 
potential costs. You’ll also need to review the corresponding specs to know how 
much materials, features and installed systems will add to the bottom line.<BR>
