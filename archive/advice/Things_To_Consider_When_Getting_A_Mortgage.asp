<span class=pageheading>Things To Consider When Getting A Mortgage</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=text>When you apply for a mortgage you need to have your important documents 
organized, a good credit history and a good pen but what else is involved? Below 
are some things to consider when looking for a mortgage: </SPAN>
<UL class=text>
<LI>Shop for a mortgage and compare the terms of various lenders. Aside from 
rates, points, etc. find out how long you can lock in a rate and get it in 
writing. 
<LI>Find out what points are involved. There are two kinds of points, pre-paid 
interest points which lowers your interest rate and origination points which is 
basically a fee to get the loan. 
<LI>You also need to find out what closing fees (attorney, filing, taxes, etc.) 
are involved. 
<LI>Do you want a fixed or adjustable rate (ARM)? Adjustable rates are lower 
than a fixed rate for the first few years but can go up whereas a fixed rate 
never changes. 
<LI>If you go with a fixed rate do you want a 15, 20 or 30year loan? If you can 
afford the higher monthly payments of a shorter-term loan then you will pay 
substantially less interest over life the term and you'll build up your equity 
faster. 
<LI>How much do you have for a down payment? If your down payment is 20% or more 
of the purchase price then you may be able to avoid monthly Private Mortgage 
Insurance (PMI) charges. 
<LI>Documents you'll need are: latest bank statements, latest W-2s and tax 
returns, copy of latest pay stubs, child support or alimony records, IRA and 
401k statements, investment account statements. 
<LI>If part of your down payment is a gift from a friend or relative you'll need 
a letter from the donor explaining that you are not obligated to repay them. 
<LI>When you apply for a loan your lender is required by law to give you the 
following: Truth-in-Lending Disclosure, A Home Buyer's Guide to Settlement 
Costs, ARM Disclosure, Your Annual Percentage Rate or "APR". Make sure you 
receive these documents and read them. 
<LI>When you apply for a loan the following will be done by your lender: an 
appraisal of the property you wish to buy, review of you credit history, 
employment and bank account verification. </LI></UL>
<P class=text>With the above in mind, it's not really that difficult to secure a loan you 
can live with. Just get your documentation organized and compare all the 
alternatives you find.</P>
