<span class=pageheading>FSBOs: Is Your Buyer Qualified?</span><br><br>
<span class=text>
Unless the buyer who makes an offer on your home has the
resources to qualify for a mortgage, you may not really have a sale. If
possible, try to determine a buyer’s financial status before signing the
contract.</span><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li>Has the buyer been prequalified or preapproved (better)
for a mortgage. Such buyers will be in a much better position to obtain a
mortgage promptly</li>

<li>Does
the buyer have enough money to make a downpayment and cover closing costs?
Ideally, a buyer should have 20 percent of the home’s price as a downpayment
and between 2 percent and 7 percent of the price to cover closing costs.</li>

<li>Is
the buyer’s income sufficient to afford your home? Ideally, buyers should spend
no more than 28 percent of total income to cover PITI (principal, interest,
taxes, and insurance).</li>

<li>Does
your buyer have good credit? Ask if he or she has reviewed and corrected a
credit report.</li>

<li>Does
the buyer have too much debt? If a buyer owes a great deal on car payments,
credit cards, etc., he or she may not qualify for a mortgage.</li>
</ol>
