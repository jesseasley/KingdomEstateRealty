<span class=pageheading>The Fine Art of Negotiating a 
Lease</SPAN><br><br>
<P class=text>That apartment lease price can come way down if you're bold enough to bargain 
with the landlord. 
<P class=text>It happens all the time. A person walks into an apartment rental 
office intent on signing a lease. The landlord barks out a price and the tenant 
signs the lease, no questions asked. Meanwhile, the landlord is laughing all the 
way to the bank.</P>
<P class=text>But it doesn't have to be that way. By asking a few questions, a 
tenant can save hundreds of dollars in rent and even get some extra amenities 
thrown in. </P><SPAN class=text></SPAN>
<P><span class=sectionheading><B>You drive a hard bargain</b></span><BR><SPAN class=text>Roll 
your sleeves up and bargain," advises Ed Sacks, a Chicago-area mediator and 
author of the "Chicago Tenant's Handbook" and "The Savvy Renter's Kit." "You ask 
the landlord, 'How much?' The landlord says, '$1,000.' You offer $850. The 
landlord counters, 'Well, that's ridiculous. I can't go below $900.' It's 
old-fashioned hardball."</SPAN></P>
<P class=text>In order to gain negotiating power, a prospective tenant should do 
some research.</P>
<P class=text>"You should look at the area and ask about the number of vacant 
apartments available," recommends Beverly Roman, publisher of BR Anchor 
Publishing in Wilmington, N.C., and author of the "Insiders' Guide to 
Relocation." High or low vacancy, "It still doesn't hurt to ask [for a price 
concession]."</P>
<P class=text>Sacks points out that a landlord's willingness to come down in 
price is often tied to supply and demand. If there are a lot of vacancies, it's 
a buyer's market, and a perfect time to negotiate the bottom line. If the number 
of apartments available is tight, then the landlord holds the upper hand -- and 
will often be as hard-line at the negotiating table as the Teamsters Union. </P>
<P class=text>"In the Northeast, it's a seller's market, no question," argues 
Fran Katzanek of Bristol, R.I., author of "Reality 101," a post-graduation guide 
to life for twentysomethings. "It's rough. There's always somebody right behind 
you. The Pacific Northwest, San Francisco and Los Angeles are highly competitive 
as well."</P>
<P class=text>Students at the University of Pittsburgh can relate, says Robert 
Hopkins, of the university's Housing Resource Center. Finding themselves rookies 
in the game and in a tight housing market, the landlord's price is "take it or 
leave it."</P>
<P class=text>"We don't have much luck in getting the students to negotiate," 
Hopkins remarks. "There is a perceived notion of a lack of power for the 
student. ... I have never heard of anybody at the student level getting a change 
of rent or negotiating conditions. ... Landlords know they can turn a student 
away. There isn't much of an occupancy problem."</P>
<P class=text>Hopkins admits that a better situation is in the suburbs of 
Pittsburgh, where the "For Rent" signs hang for longer periods of time. This 
situation allows renters to negotiate on more level ground for such things as 
signing a 13-month lease for the price of 12 months or a free cable television 
included with the rent. </P>

<P class=text>The following is a list of general rules and ideas to keep in 
mind when renting an apartment, according to Beverly Roman, author of "The 
Insiders' Guide to Relocation." </P>
<P class=text>Keep in mind that renter's rights and responsibilities vary by 
locality. Be sure to check on local laws that apply in your 
area.<BR><BR>Generally, a landlord or maintenance worker is prohibited from 
entering your apartment without your permission. You have a right to privacy. 
</P>
<P class=text>Be sure you are aware of the amount of time in advance both you 
and the landlord must give to terminate the lease. </P>
<P class=text>Inspect the apartment before moving in and take pictures of the 
damage with a date stamp on the film. Inform the landlord in writing of any 
problems.</P>
<P class=text>Make sure there are no blank spaces on the lease. </P>
<P class=text>Some unscrupulous landlords will fill in the blanks later 
without your knowledge. </P>
<P><SPAN class=text>Look for an apartment that offers 24-hour maintenance. 
You never know when something vital will break down. 
<BR></SPAN></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P><span class=sectionheading><b>Poker face</b></span><BR><SPAN class=text>"If you don't ask a 
question, you'll never get another answer," adds Hopkins. "At worst, you still 
have the terms and conditions that they originally offered."</SPAN></P>
<P class=text>To help win the bargaining battle, author Sacks recommends that 
renters bring in competing advertisements for comparable new and old apartments 
in the area. You will have some negotiating leverage to compete with the 
landlord's offering price. If the landlord offers a 1000-square-foot apartment 
for $900 a month, and the renter has a competing ad in hand that prices a 
similar-size unit in the area at $850, it's game ... set ... match for the 
tenant. </P>
<P class=text>Another place where the tenant has some bargaining power is in a 
new apartment complex, where management is anxious to fill up vacancies as soon 
as possible. In this situation, Roman suggests asking for a construction 
discount, if the hammer and nails are still banging, or a moving-in special if 
the building is complete but still empty of residents. </P>
<P><span class=sectionheading><b>Ask for the moon</b></span><BR><SPAN class=text>"The main 
mistake tenants make is not asking for enough," says Tom Blakeman, owner and 
broker for Blakeman Properties, a tenant's agent firm for renting homes and 
condominiums in Houston. </SPAN></P>
<P class=text>"You can ask for anything you want," insists Sacks.</P>
<P class=text>There are other ways to gain in negotiating, besides haggling on 
price, that can save you money on the bottom line and add some nice perks to 
your environment. If you are thinking of staying for several years, negotiate a 
longer lease term for two or three years. You might not get a lower rent price, 
but you can save money by locking in at your current rate, without the worry of 
a rent increase after a year in the apartment, Sacks advises. </P>
<P class=text>Also, look to bargain on amenities. For example, an apartment 
complex might throw in a health club membership, new carpeting, fresh paint and 
wallpaper, if you open your mouth and pop the question. </P>
<P class=text>Some renters will use peeling wallpaper and paint as negotiating 
ploys. Renters can mention the problem to the landlord during negotiations, and 
state that they can live with it for, say, $100 a month off the rent. A 
landlord, looking to avoid expensive repairs, may be receptive. </P>
<P><span class=sectionheading><b>Working for a living</b></span><BR><SPAN class=text>Another 
way to save on rent is to offer to perform routine maintenance work around the 
apartment complex in exchange for a price cut. A renter can perform duties like 
mowing the lawn and vacuuming the hallways as a barter deal for cheaper rent, 
according to Sacks.</SPAN></P>
<P class=text>Finally, for those that are current tenants with leases coming 
due, don't be gun-shy on balking at the owner's asking price. Good tenants who 
pay their bills on time and are not a nuisance to neighbors are valuable to 
landlords. </P>
<P class=text>"With a replacement, a landlord has no idea how it will work out," 
states Sacks. "Dependability and trust are leverage. ... The landlord avoids the 
cost of having the place empty and having to fix it up. ... It will probably be 
the landlord's loss if you move out."</P>
<P class=text>If all else fails, just remind the landlord how popular it is to 
buy a house these days. And then make a counteroffer. The worst they can say is 
"forgetaboutit." Of course, in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest and California, 
you probably already know the answer before the question is asked.</P>
