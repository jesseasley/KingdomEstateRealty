<span class=pageheading>7 Terms to Watch for in a Purchase Contract</span><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li><b>The closing date</b>. See if the date the buyer wants to take title is reasonable for you.</li>

<li><b>Date of possession</b>. See if the date the buyer wants to move in is reasonable for you.</li>

<li><b>The earnest money</b>. Look for the largest earnest-money deposit possible; since it is
forfeited if the buyer backs out, a large deposit is usually a good indication
of a sincere buyer.</li>

<li><b>Fixtures and personal property</b>. Check the list of items that the buyer expects to
remain with the property and be sure it’s acceptable.</li>

<li><b>Repairs</b>.
Determine what the requested repairs will cost and whether you’re willing to do
the work or would rather lower the price by that amount.</li>

<li><b>Contingencies</b>.
See what other factors the buyer wants met before the contract is
final—inspections, selling a home, obtaining a mortgage, review of the contract
by an attorney. Set time limits on contingencies so that they won’t drag on and
keep your sale from becoming final.</li>

<li><b>The contract expiration date</b> See how long you have to make a decision on
the offer.</li>
</ol>
