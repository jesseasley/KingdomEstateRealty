<span class=pageheading>10 Ways to Make Your House
More Salable</span><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li>Get rid of clutter. Throw out or file stacks of
newspapers and magazines. Pack away most of your small decorative items. Store
out-of-season clothing to make closets seem roomier. Clean out the garage.</li>

<li>Wash your windows and screens to let more light into
the interior.</li>

<li>Keep everything extra clean. Wash fingerprints from light switch plates.
Mop and wax floors. Clean the stove and refrigerator. A clean house makes a
better first impression and convinces buyers that the home has been well cared
for.</li>

<li>Get rid of smells. Clean carpeting and drapes to
eliminate cooking odors, smoke, and pet smells. Open the windows.</li>

<li>Put higher wattage bulbs in light sockets to make
rooms seem brighter, especially basements and other dark rooms. Replace any
burnt-out bulbs.</li>

<li>Make minor repairs that can create a bad impression.
Small problems, such as sticky doors, torn screens, cracked caulking, or a
dripping faucet, may seem trivial, but they’ll give buyers the impression that
the house isn’t well maintained.</li>

<li>Tidy your yard. Cut the grass, rake the leaves, trim
the bushes, and edge the walks. Put a pot or two of bright flowers near the
entryway.</li>

<li>Patch holes in your driveway and reapply sealant, if
applicable.</li>

<li>Clean your gutters.</li>

<li>Polish your front doorknob and door numbers.</li>
