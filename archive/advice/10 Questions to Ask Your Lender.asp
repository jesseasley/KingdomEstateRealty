<span class=text>Be sure you find a loan that fits your needs with these comprehensive
questions.</span>


<ol class=text>
<li>What are the most popular mortgage loans you offer?</li>

<li>Which type of mortgage plan do you think would be best
for us? Why?</li>

<li>Are your rates, terms, fees, and closing costs negotiable?</li>

<li>Will I have to buy private mortgage insurance? If so
how much will it cost and how long will it be required? NOTE: Private mortgage
insurance usually is required if you make less than a 20 percent downpayment,
but most lenders will let you discontinue the policy when you’ve acquired a
certain amount of equity by paying down the loan.</li>

<li>Who will service the loan? Your bank or another
company?</li>

<li>What escrow requirements do you have?</li>

<li>How long is your loan lock-in period (the time that
the quoted interest rate will be honored)? Will I be able to obtain a lower
rate if they drop during this period?</li>

<li>How long will the loan approval process take?</li>

<li>How long will it take to close the loan?</li>

<li>Are there any charges or penalties for prepaying the
loan?
