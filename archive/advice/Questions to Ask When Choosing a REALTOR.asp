 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How long have you been
     in residential real estate sales? Is it your full-time job? (While
     experience is no guarantee of skill, real estate, like many other
     professions, is mostly learned on the job.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>What designations do
     you hold? (Designations, such as GRI and CRS</span><sup><span

     real estate professionals take additional, specialized real estate
     training, are held by only about one-quarter of real estate
     practitioners.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>

 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How many homes did you
     and your company sell last year?<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How many days did it
     take you to sell the average home? How did that compare to the overall
     market?<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How close to the
     initial asking prices of the homes you sold were the final sale prices?<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>What types of specific
     marketing systems and approaches will you use to sell my home? (Look for
     someone who has aggressive, innovative approaches, not just someone who’s
     going to put a sign in the yard and hope for the best.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Will you represent me
     exclusively, or will you represent both the buyer and the seller in the
     transaction? (While it’s usually legal to represent both parties in a
     transaction, it’s important to understand where the practitioner’s
     obligations lie. A good practitioner will explain the agency relationship
     to you and describe the rights of each party. It’s also possible to insist
     that the practitioner represent you exclusively.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Can you recommend
     service providers who can assist me in obtaining a mortgage, making
     repairs on my home, and other things I need done? (Keep in mind here that
     real estate professionals should generally recommend more than one
     provider and should tell you if they receive any compensation from any
     provider.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>What type of support
     and supervision does your brokerage office provide to you? (Having
     resources, such as in-house support staff, access to a real estate
     attorney, or assistance with technology, can help a real estate
     professional sell your home.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>What’s your business
     philosophy? (While there’s no right answer to this question, the response
     will help you assess what’s important to the real estate practitioner—fast
     sales, service, etc.—and determine how closely the practitioner’s goals
     and business emphasis mesh with your own.)<o:p></o:p></span></li>
<br><br>
 <li class=text style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How will you keep me
     informed about the progress of my transaction? How frequently? Using what
     media? (Again, this is not a question with a correct answer, but that one
     reflects your desires. Do you want updates twice a week or don’t want to
     be bothered unless there’s a hot prospect? Do you prefer phone, e-mail, or
     a personal visit?)<o:p></o:p></span></li>

     me the names and phone numbers of your three most recent clients?</span></li>
