<span class=pageheading>8 Ways to Improve Your Credit</span><br><br>


<p class="text">Credit scores, along with your overall income and debt, are
a big factor in determining if you’ll qualify for a loan and what loan terms
you’ll be able to qualify for.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Check
for and correct errors in your credit report. Mistakes happen, and you could be
paying for someone else’s poor financial management.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Pay
down credit card bills. If possible, pay off the entire balance every month.
However, transferring credit card debt from one card to another could lower
your score.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Don’t
charge your credit cards to the maximum limit.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Wait
12 months after credit difficulties to apply for a mortgage. You’re penalized
less for problems after a year.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Don’t
purchase big-ticket items for your new home on credit cards until after the
loan is approved. The amounts will add to your debt.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Don’t
open new credit card accounts before applying for a mortgage. Having too much
available credit can lower your score.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Shop
for mortgage rates all at once. Too many credit applications can lower your
score, but multiple inquiries from the same type of lender are counted as one
inquiry if submitted over a short period of time.</p>


<p class="text" style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
<![endif]>Avoid
finance companies. Even if you pay the loan on time, the interest is high and
it will probably be considered a sign of poor credit management.</p>
