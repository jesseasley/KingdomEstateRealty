<span class=pageheading>Tips for Finding the Perfect Neighborhood</span><br><br>


<p class="text">The neighborhood you choose can have a big impact on your
lifestyle—safety, available amenities, and convenience all play their part.</p>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Make a
     list of the activities—movies, health club, church—you engage in regularly
     and stores you visit frequently. See how far you would have to travel from
     each neighborhood you’re considering to engaging in your most common
     activities.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Check
     out the school district. The Department of Education in your town can
     probably provide information on test scores, class size, percentage of
     students who attend college, and special enrichment programs. If you have
     school-age children, also consider paying a visit to schools in the
     neighborhoods you’re considering. Even if you don’t have children, a house
     in a good school district will be easier to sell in the future.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Find
     out if the neighborhood is safe. Ask the police department for
     neighborhood crime statistics. Consider not only the number of crimes but
     also the type—burglaries, armed robberies—and the trend of increasing or
     decreasing crime. Also, is crime centered in only one part of the
     neighborhood, such as near a retail area?</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Determine
     if the neighborhood is economically stable. Check with your local city
     economic development office to see if income and property values in the
     neighborhood are stable or rising. What is the percentage of homes to
     apartments? Apartments don’t necessarily diminish value, but they do mean
     a more transient population. Do you see vacant businesses or homes that
     have been for sale for months?</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>See if
     you’ll make money. Ask a local REALTOR<sup><span style='font-family:Symbol;
     mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";
     mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span
     style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>Ò</span></span></sup>
     or call the local REALTOR<sup><span style='font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:
     "Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:
     symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;
     mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>Ò</span></span> </sup>association to get
     information about price appreciation trends in the neighborhood. Although
     past performance is no guarantee of future results, this information may
     give you a sense of how good an investment your home will be. A REALTOR<sup><span
     style='font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";
     mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
     Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>Ò</span></span></sup>
     or the government planning agency also may be able to tell you about
     planned developments or other changes in the neighborhood—like a new
     school or highway—that might affect value.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>See
     for yourself. Once you’ve narrowed your focus to two or three
     neighborhoods, go there, and walk around. Are homes tidy and well
     maintained? Are streets quiet? Pick a warm day if you can and chat with
     people working or playing outside. Are they friendly? Are their children
     to play with your family?</li>
</ol>
