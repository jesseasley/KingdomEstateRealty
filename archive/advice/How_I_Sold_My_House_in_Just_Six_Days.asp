<DIV class="text">When my agent listed my house on June 8, she included 
what I feared was too bold a directive: "Seller will review all offers on June 
14." All offers? What if there were no offers?<BR><BR>Such a technique was 
common during the real-estate boom. But more recently, I've mostly seen the 
tactic used when a home is in excellent shape -- a message that a lot of time 
(and possibly, money) was spent making the house move-in ready and that a buyer 
should act quickly. I wondered whether my place was really in such good shape 
and worried buyers might be scared away.<BR><BR><IMG

Samantha Macintosh, my agent, assured me that the stipulation was only for 
real-estate agents to see and would encourage them to bring serious buyers. If 
we didn't receive offers by our June 14 noon deadline, she would remove it from 
the listing, she said.<BR><BR>I wasn't optimistic about finding a buyer so 
quickly. The open house was short (from noon to 2PM). It took place on a sunny 
day that followed one of heavy rain (I do live in Seattle), which made me wonder 
whether buyers opted to spend the day outdoors instead of home shopping. Less 
than 10 people attended, and while feedback was often positive -- many said my 
place was "cute" -- it wasn’t in any way apparent that an offer would come 
quickly. Feedback wasn’t completely positive: One agent said it was too 
"tilted," perhaps referring to settling on the sun porch/mud room. Twenty-four 
hours later, my home had been saved on Yahoo in 138 buyers' home-search lists, 
according to Steve Lamb, my agent's business partner and a former 
techie.<BR><BR>"This is the activity that's taken place only on Yahoo's 
real-estate site, so it's just a small sampling, but interesting nonetheless," 
he wrote in an e-mail.<BR><BR>By June 11, I had received 10 to 15 calls from 
interested buyers agents. (My agent had asked if I wanted a call before 
showings. I thought it'd be nice to know when visits were taking place so I'd 
know not to stop by for mail or in case the cleaners I hired for weekly 
touch-ups were inside.)<BR><BR>Sitting in my car outside one day and waiting for 
two friends to meet me for a view of my remodeling efforts, I saw an agent pull 
up. I thought about chasing her and her clients, a couple, inside for an 
"accidental" meet-the-seller moment.<BR><BR>"Don't mind my car, or my outfit," 
I'd tell them. "I spent every penny I have on this house!"<BR><BR>As June 13 
dawned, no buyers had indicated they would make an offer. Ms. Macintosh and Mr. 
Lamb had forwarded me feedback from buyers agents throughout the week. Several 
said they thought the home was tip-top or "charming," but one house hunter 
wanted a garage, while another thought the front steps were too steep for her 
aging parents.<BR><BR>That afternoon, I started getting calls from agents -- 
asking if they could take buyers in, possibly as late as 9PM. No problem -- my 
agent and I decided to wait until Thursday for any offers.<BR><BR>An agent 
called Wednesday afternoon and said she had a young married couple which was 
interested. The two were familiar with West Seattle and had lost a home to 
another bid.<BR><BR>I didn't hear anything until about 11AM on Thursday, when 
the couple's agent called, nervous they weren't going to get an offer in by the 
noon cutoff. The pair had spent the morning double-checking their financing in 
advance of making an offer. We extended the deadline since my agent and I 
couldn't meet until the evening. By 6PM, I had a full-price offer with a request 
that I pay $7,000 in closing costs and a closing date of July 19. The offer 
included a note from the buyers saying how much they loved the home. I took the 
offer, with some modifications.<BR><BR>I will pay the $7,000, but the buyers 
will put $4,000 more into their mortgage. I will end up getting $3,000 under my 
asking price ($374,950) and will settle my home's sale before I close on my new 
home. Because of the July 19 closing date, I won't pay double mortgage payments. 
The commission I pay will be calculated on a $374,950 house price, rather than 
the mortgaged price of $378,950 (a savings of less than $100).<BR><BR>We have to 
get through the inspection first and see if more discounts are requested by the 
buyers, but I think the deal will work out. I'm pleased that the eight weeks of 
preparation helped us to sell the house in just six days.<BR>
