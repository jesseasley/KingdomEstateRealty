										<span class=pageheading>Five Ways to Get Top Dollar in Any 
										Market</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=text>These key factors will help 
												you sell your 
												home faster and for more money.</SPAN><br><br><span class=sectionheading>
												These five success strategies 
												include:</SPAN><br><br>
												<ol class=text>
													<li>Pricing the property 
													correctly 
													</li>
													<li>Cleanliness of the home 
													</li>
													<li>Easy accessibility for 
													showings 
													</li>
													<li>Condition of the home 
													</li>
													<li>Curb appeal </li>
												</ol>
												<span class=sectionheading>Pricing it correctly</SPAN><br><br>
												<p class=text>Pricing your home correctly 
												is essential to selling it 
												quickly and for the most money. 
												The first 4 to 6 weeks are 
												critical when selling your 
												home. Because 
												the market is so competitive, 
												overpricing it by just a few 
												thousand dollars could mean it 
												will languish on the market too 
												long. A home that’s been on the 
												market too long will become 
												stale (with only new buyers to 
												the market looking at it) and 
												buyers will assume something’s 
												wrong with it. Pricing it at its 
												fair market value will bring in 
												more offers from more qualified 
												buyers. Not sure what price is 
												right for your home? Jess can provide an expert

												<span class=sectionheading>Cleanliness of the home</SPAN><br><br>
												<p class=text>A dirty, unkempt home is 
												extremely negative to potential 
												buyers. Nothing stops a buyer 
												from further investigation of a 
												home than a mess. It is 
												imperative that your home be 
												clean, uncluttered and free of 
												offensive odors. </p>
												<p class=text>We, as homeowners, tend to 
												overlook small things such as 
												finger-smudged lightswitch 
												plates, dirty walls and clutter, 
												but potential buyers won’t. They 
												expect a potential home to be 
												clean and well maintained. You 
												may not smell the odor of your 
												pets, diapers or cigarettes but 
												buyers will! Eliminate all odors 
												by removing the offending item 
												and airing out the home.</p>
												<p class=text>Why not
												<a class=text href="mailto:jess@easley-realty.com">
												contact Jess</a> and have him walk through 
												your home and objectively note 
												items he finds. Then act on 
												his professional 
												recommendations. You will be 
												able to sell your home faster 
												and net hundreds, if not 
												thousands, of dollars more by 
												doing these simple things.</p>
												<span class=sectionheading>Is your 
												home easily accessible to be 
												shown?</SPAN><br><br>
												<p class=text>Does your home have a key box 
												installed so that an agent can 
												show your home when necessary? 
												If not, they may pass on showing 
												your home. Having a key box 
												installed at your home is a good 
												idea.</p>
												<p class=text>It is also recommended that 
												you do the following:</p>
												<ul class=text>
													<li>Keep lights on 
													</li>
													<li>Keep drapes and shutters 
													open 
													</li>
													<li>Have soft music playing 
													</li>
													<li>Leave while the house is 
													being shown 
													</li>
													<li>Fresh cut flowers offer 
													a touch of style and a sweet 
													aroma </li>
												</ul>
												<span class=sectionheading>Condition of the home</SPAN><br><br>
												<p class=text>Your home MUST seem as though 
												it has been well maintained. 
												Paint is one of the best and 
												least expensive ways to improve 
												your home. A neutral color helps 
												a potential owner imagine their 
												belongings fitting in there. 
												Also, if your carpet is dirty, 
												worn or an unusual color you 
												should have it professionally 
												cleaned if dirty or consider 
												replacing it if it is worn or 
												outdated. It’s one of the best 
												returns on your investment 
												dollars you can make. </p>
												<p class=text>Repair any leaky faucets, 
												faulty electrical outlets, etc. 
												to show your buyers you’ve kept 
												your home in outstanding 
												condition.</p>
												<span class=sectionheading>Creating curb appeal</SPAN><br><br>
												<p class=text>Nothing is more inviting than 
												an attractive home. And since 
												the entry way and /or exterior 
												is the first thing a potential 
												buyer sees, it can make or break 
												a sale. The entrance of your 
												home MUST be clean, well 
												maintained and appealing.
