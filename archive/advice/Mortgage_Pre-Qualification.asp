<span class=pageheading>Mortgage Pre-Qualification</span><br><br>
<span class="text">Before you seriously start looking for a new home you should pre-qualify for a 
mortgage. Getting pre-qualified does several things to your advantage: </span>
<UL class=text>
<LI>Helps your real estate agent narrow your search to homes in your price 
range. You, and your agent, don't want to waste time looking at homes that will 
over-extend you or those too small for your needs. You might be pleasantly 
surprised at the amount of home you can afford. 
<LI>Lets sellers and their real estate agent know that you are serious when you 
make an offer. 
<LI>Avoids delays in the negotiating process. In a hot market you can't afford 
to wait for a loan approval when you are making an offer. Other offers can come 
in on your perfect home and be accepted while you are waiting for approval. 
<LI>Helps you set up a budget. If you know what your maximum monthly mortgage 
payments may be then you can plan for other monthly expenses. </LI></UL>
