<span class=pageheading>Top Home Danger Zones</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=sectionheading>Don’t overlook the maintenance projects and safety measures that can keep 
you and your family from harm</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class=text>Home Sweet Home can harbor many dangers that are easy 
to put off fixing or overlooked altogether. Before autumn arrives, take time to 
secure your home inside and out to prevent the following from impacting your 
family’s safety and security.<BR><BR><B>Inside the house</B><BR>• Insufficient 
fire protection: Buying a bunch of smoke detectors isn’t enough…you actually 
have to install and maintain them. Both steps are easy with contemporary models, 
some of which allow battery power status to be checked by remote.<BR>• Carbon 
monoxide (CO) poisoning: HVAC systems, autos and outdoor machinery can be 
sources of this odorless, colorless, deadly gas. Make sure you’re warned that CO 
is on the scene by installing carbon monoxide detectors (also available in 
smoke-CO detector combinations) throughout your home, and never run your car or 
any other fuel-burning machines in even a partially closed garage.<BR>• Bathroom 
dangers: Family members of all ages are at risk for slips and falls in slick 
tubs and showers and on slippery bathroom floors. Install grab bars in strategic 
locations around the space, and roll out non-slip area rugs over tile and vinyl 
flooring. Also make sure that small children are attended at all times while 
bathing and keep toilet lids closed, as little ones can drown in just a few 
inches of water.<BR>• Clogged dryer exhaust duct: Every year an average of 
14,500 dryers catch fire and are responsible for up to ten deaths-not because of 
wiring problems, but the lint that collects in the dryer’s exhaust ducts. Keep 
the laundry area safe by doing an annual or bi-annual cleaning of the duct, 
using a tool made for the purpose which snakes a rotary brush through the line 
and attaches to the chuck of a cordless drill on one end for easy 
operation.<BR>• Unsteady stairs: Keep stairways clear of toys and other items 
that could be tripped over, and make sure banisters are secure and easy to grip. 
Install handrails on both sides of the stairs at approximately 34 inches above 
the nose of the steps.<BR>• Unsecured storage for medications and chemicals: 
Inquisitive youngsters and family pets can find dangerous substances in a flash, 
so don’t take chances. Make sure all medications and household chemicals are 
stored out of reach in locked cabinets.<BR>• Dirty chimney: Creosote buildup 
from all of those evenings by the hearth can lead to a roaring flue fire, so 
have chimneys checked and cleaned well before the heating season begins.<BR>• 
Portable space heaters: Yes, they’re convenient, but they’re also fire hazards 
if left unattended or within reach of draperies, furnishings and other 
flammables. If you must use a space heater, make sure it’s off when you’re not 
around, and allow it to cool thoroughly before moving it to another 
location.<BR>• Unstoppable garage door: Today’s garage doors must include a 
safety feature enabling them to immediately reverse direction if they come in 
contact with an obstruction. Test your door occasionally to ensure that this 
important feature is functioning properly. <BR>• Termite infestation: Termites 
cause billions of dollars in structural damage every year, with much of it on 
the home front. At the first sign of an infestation, call your local 
exterminator; otherwise, these unwelcome visitors could eat your home right out 
from under you.<BR>• Got rot? This dangerous wood decay is started by an 
invasive, moisture-loving fungus, and poses a major threat to the structural 
integrity of a home. Work with a pro to quickly replace or rebuild any areas 
where dry rot has struck.<BR>• Mold: An often-hidden health threat, mold hurts 
people as well as surfaces. Keep it at bay by managing moisture and airflow, and 
containing organic substances that serve as its “food.”<BR><BR><BR><B>Outside 
the house</B><BR>• Clogged gutters: Not only do gunked-up gutters keep rainwater 
from flowing freely, they can also end up sending it close to a home’s 
foundation and into interior spaces where it creates moisture and mold problems. 
Give gutters a seasonal cleaning, and make sure they dispense water on a 
downward slope well away from the structure.<BR>• Loose roof shingles: A shingle 
missing here or there may not seem like a big deal, but as the underlayments and 
roof structure are exposed, cracks and splits can develop and allow water to 
leak inside to do damage. Don’t wait to tend to roof repairs, and don’t allow 
them to take the place of a new surface if that’s what’s really needed.<BR>• 
Pools and hot tubs: They may be fun for the family, but they’re also grave 
dangers for drowning. Use locked covers and secure fencing to prevent accidents 
between pool parties, and never leave children unattended as they swim and 
play.<BR>• Unfinished finishes: That paint job that never quite got completed 
isn’t just an eyesore-it’s an invitation to wear and even rot where surfaces 
have been left exposed. If you can’t get to the job yourself, hire a pro to 
finish putting on that new coat of color.<BR>• Untrimmed trees: Employ a 
reputable care and trimming service to tend to the trees on your property. The 
pruning and monitoring they’ll do will prevent dangerous bough breaks as well as 
keep your landscaping looking beautiful. <BR><BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class=text>Along with the nuts and bolts above, be sure to do a 
regular reassessment and adjustment of your homeowners insurance. It may mean 
sacrifice of a little time and a few dollars, but you’ll be glad to have done 
both if a major home emergency ever befalls you.<BR>
