<span class=pageheading>10 Ways to Lower Your Homeowners Insurance Costs</SPAN><br><br>

<ol class=text>
<li><b>Raise your
deductible.</b> If you can afford to pay
more toward a loss that occurs, your premiums will be lower.</li>

<li><b>Buy your
homeowners and auto policies from the same company.</b> You’ll usually qualify for a discount. But make sure
that the savings really yields the lowest price.</li>

<li><b>Make your home
less susceptible to damage.</b> Keep
roofs and drains in good repair. Retrofit your house to protect against natural
disasters common to your area.</li>

<li><b>Keep your home
safer.</b> Install smoke detectors,
burglar alarms, and dead-bolt locks. All of these will usually qualify for a
discount.</li>

<li><b>Be sure you
insure your house for the correct amount.</b>
Remember, you’re covering replacement cost, not market value.</li>

<li><b>Ask about
other discounts.</b> For example,
retirees who are home more than working people may qualify for a discount on
theft insurance.</li>

<li><b>Stay with the
same insurer.</b> Especially in today’s
tight insurance market, your current vendor is more likely to give you a good
price.</li>

<li><b>See if you
belong to any groups</b>—associations,
alumni groups—that offer lower insurance rates.</li>

<li><b>Review your
policy limits and the value of your home and possessions annually.</b> Some items depreciate and may not need as much
coverage.</li>

<li><b>See if there’s
a government-backed insurance plan.</b>
In some high-risk areas, such as the coasts, federal or state governments may
back plans to lower rates. Ask your agent.</li>
