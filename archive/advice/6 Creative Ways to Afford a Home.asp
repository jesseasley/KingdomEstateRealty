<span class=pageheading>6 Creative Ways to Afford a Home</span><br><br>

<span class=text>If your income and savings
are making homebuying a challenge, consider these options.</span>

<ol class=text><li>
Investigate local, state, and national downpayment
assistance programs. These programs give loans or grants to cover all or part
of your required downpayment. National programs include the Nehemiah program
(<a class=text href="http://www.getdownpayment.com" target="_empty">http://www.getdownpayment.com</a>) and the American Dream Downpayment Fund from
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (<a class=text href="http://www.hud.gov" target="_empty">http://www.hud.gov</a>).</li>

<li>Get the seller to provide financing. In some cases,
sellers may be willing to finance all or part of the purchase price of the home
and let you repay them gradually, just as you do a mortgage.</li>

<li>Consider a shared-appreciation, or shared equity,
arrangement. Under this arrangement, your family, friends, or even a
third-party may buy a portion of the home and thus share in any appreciation
when the home is sold. The owner/occupant usually pays the mortgage, property
taxes, and all maintenance costs, but all investors’ names are usually on the
mortgage. There are companies that can help you find such an investor if your
family can’t participate.</li>

<li>Get help from your family. Perhaps a family member
will loan you money for the downpayment and/or act as a cosigner for the
mortgage. Lenders often like to have a cosigner if you have little credit
history</li>

<li>Lease with the option to buy. Renting the home for a
year or more will give you the chance to save more toward your downpayment. And
in many cases, owners will apply some of the rental amount toward the purchase
price. You usually have to pay a small, nonrefundable option fee to the owner.</li>

<li>See if you can qualify for a short-term second
mortgage to give you the money to make a higher downpayment. This may be
possible if you have a good income and little other debt.
