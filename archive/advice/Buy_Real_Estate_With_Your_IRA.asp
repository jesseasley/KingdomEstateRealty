<span class=pageheading>Buy Real Estate With Your IRA?</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class=text>Many investors don’t realize that the long list of 
investments they can put in their individual retirement account includes real 
estate.<BR><BR>Tax law lets people put nearly anything in their retirement 
accounts. Not only is investment in real estate okay, but so are business 
investments and even gold coins. Life insurance and collectables, however, are 
ruled out.<BR><BR>Real estate has looked particularly attractive to investors 
since the dot com collapse. Since then real estate has soared and while the 
NASDAQ has stalled below half its 2000 peak.<BR><BR>The vehicles offer investors 
the chance for potentially higher rewards—and risk—than in the typical brokerage 
house investments. Investors could always get real estate in their retirement 
portfolio by investing in a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). 
But these pooled investments don’t have the high potential for growth a single 
property might. One early adopter to the program split an $8,000 piece of 
commercial land with a friend, figuring it was a parking lot prospect, says 
Kelli L. Click is vice president of sales and marketing at Sterling Trust Co. in 
Waco, Tx. Instead it became scarce billboard space that sold for 
$500,000.<BR><BR>That doesn’t mean putting real estate in your IRA is easy or 
common. The rules are tricky. You can’t just cash out your IRA to go buy a 
second home in Wisconsin.<BR><BR>If you run afoul of the IRS rules, you may be 
in for punishing taxes and fines, including the 10% penalty for an early 
withdrawal from an IRA on top of income taxes at your usual rate. Then there’s a 
15% ding for breaking the rules for these kind of funds.<BR><BR>Here are some of 
the guidelines: — You can’t own the property directly yourself. You need to get 
an independent IRA custodian. Look for someone who advertises as “real estate 
IRA” or “self-directed IRA,” advises Click. Understand their fee structure. Will 
they just set up the account? Or also manage the property?<BR><BR>— The IRS will 
let you purchase virtually any kind of real estate property: raw land, condos, 
houses, or commercial real estate. Make sure your custodian does the kind of 
property you’re interested in.<BR><BR>— No matter how good an investment you 
think it is, your IRA account can’t buy a property that you already own outside 
the account. And your IRA account can’t buy or sell to certain close family 
members either.<BR><BR>— If you’re taking out money for the property, it has to 
be a “non-recourse” loan. That means the property is put up as collateral and if 
you default, the lender can’t come after you personally, even if the property 
value fell so much it doesn’t cover the loan amount. The loans can be hard to 
come by, says Glick, so many investors split the property with friends if they 
can’t afford it themselves.<BR><BR>— Stay away from the property. Keep an arm’s 
length physically and financially. The IRS means this to be an investment 
property, not your office or vacation spot. So, don’t go over to the house and 
start working on the plumbing, even though you may see it as just protecting 
your investment. You can’t live there, work there, or vacation there—even if you 
paid your IRA account rent.<BR><BR>— That goes for your family, too. If you’re 
thinking you could just rent the house to your mom or have your son-in-law paint 
it for cheap, the IRS is onto you. They have a specific list of “prohibited 
persons”—ancestors (you know them as your parents and grandparents), direct 
descendants and their spouses—and the same rules apply to them.<BR><BR>— Because 
you’re not allowed to do it, you need to hire people to manage the property, 
from finding tenants to doing basic maintenance and repairs.<BR><BR>— Make sure 
that what happens in the IRA account, stays in the IRA account. That means all 
the IRA account alone pays all fees, expenses and taxes for the property and 
collects all rents. However, you don’t have to own the whole property. You can 
split the ownership with someone else—even someone who isn’t holding it as part 
of an IRACK.<BR><BR>— Because buying a property requires a big upfront cost and 
then potentially high maintenance costs, this is an investment for someone who 
already has a lot of money in their IRA.<BR><BR>— Check your overall asset 
allocation. What is the value of all you own, including your house, any other 
properties or investments and any bank, stock, bond or mutual fund accounts? Now 
how much of that is already in real estate?<BR>
