<DIV class="text"><B>1. Make your house look like you don’t live 
there</B><BR>Give your house the un-lived in look. Scrub, paint and 
depersonalize. Let buyers easily imagine themselves living there -- which is 
hard to do if all they see are mementos of you and your life. Don’t let anyone 
see your overstuffed junk drawer.<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class="text">You may have thought you were saving money by putting 
off repairs, but you weren’t. Now’s the time to fix all the little things that 
bug you -- leaky faucets, loose railings, pealing paint. Put in brighter lights 
and landscaping. Everyone is wise to the trick of baking bread or brewing 
potpourri to make the place smell nice, but do it anyway.<BR><BR>Pat Vredevoogd 
Combs, president-elect of the National Association of Realtors, says pay 
attention to your front door: “Most people don’t use their front door, but 
that’s where your buyers are going to come in, even if it’s the last time they 
walk through that door.”<BR><BR><A name=inspect><B>2. Consider an 
inspection</B></A><BR>If there’s a problem, get an early heads up and fix it. 
Your buyer will want their own inspection anyway, though.<BR><BR><A 
name=method><B>3. Choose the method for selling your house</B><BR></A>Your 
parents would've just asked friends for a real estate broker, but there’s no one 
right way to sell a house anymore. Realtors can be a trusted guide through this 
tense process. But some want to avoid paying the hefty 5-7 percent 
commission.<BR><BR>Today you can negotiate with a traditional full-service 
broker or pick someone else’s services ala carte. Ask exactly what exactly 
you’ll get. Some discount brokers might not hussle to sell your home, but will 
put it on the Multiple Listing Service or MLS. Selling yourself is more work, 
but many online listing services offer packages and guidance. For an extra fee, 
you get on the MLS, which may mean paying a buyer’s agent’s fee.<BR><BR><A 
name=pricing><B>4. Set the price</B><BR></A>You or your realtor will analyze the 
local real estate market, looking at recent prices of similar homes. You may be 
in for a surprise if you’ve rationalized a big movie room or deck would “pay for 
itself.” (Kitchen and bathroom improvements are the best investments.) The price 
will depend mostly on the local market.<BR><BR><A name=market><B>5. Market your 
house</B><BR></A>You or your realtor has to get as many potential buyers as 
possible aware of your house. Your options include newspaper ads, online 
listings, yard signs and open houses.<BR><BR>Houses are staying on the market 
longer as the housing market cools. You may have to adjust your price down or 
add incentives to the buyer, such as paying closing costs. Or you may add a 
warranty to the house for about $500 to pay for certain repairs in the first 
year.<BR><BR><A name=offers><B>6. Consider the offers and accept 
one</B><BR></A>When someone offers enough money, you’ll need to assess whether 
it’s enough and whether you think you the buyer will come through. How big is 
their downpayment? Do they have too many conditions? Typically buyers get to 
back out if they can’t get financing or the home inspection turns up big 
trouble. Others want to wait till their house sells. Lately some require that 
they be able to find homeowner’s insurance.<BR><BR>At this point, you’ll need 
some help, whether that’s a realtor, real estate lawyer or title services 
company.<BR><BR><A name=close><B>7. Close the deal</B><BR></A>If all goes 
smoothly, about a month after the contract, you’ll sit down with the buyer’s 
representatives and sign the contracts. In a matter of days you’ll get your 
money, the equity you’ve built up in the house, minus any commissions.<BR>
