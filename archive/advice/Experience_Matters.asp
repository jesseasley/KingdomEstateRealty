professional are many: </P>

estate market. If they don't have first hand knowledge of an area then they 
probably know a fellow real estate professional who does.

<LI>By working with you, a real estate professional will know what interests you 
and watch for new homes on the market that match those interests.

your needs and not let you get sidetracked by amenities that don't add value to 
your purchase. 
<LI>A real estate professional has working relationships with appraisers, 
inspectors, mortgage lenders, title insurers, movers, attorneys, etc. These 
relationships make the entire buying process much smoother than it would if you 
had to find all these resources yourself.

homes in the area are selling for. 
<LI>A great resource of information throughout the searching, offering, closing 
process and after you move into your new home. </LI></UL><P class=text>As a real estate
