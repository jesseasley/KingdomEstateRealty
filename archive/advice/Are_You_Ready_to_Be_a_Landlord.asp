<span class=pageheading>Are You Ready to Be a Landlord?</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class=text>Does it seem like everybody around you is getting rich 
off real estate? It’s a tempting scenario to buy a place, rent it out and have a 
tenant pay your mortgage. Be forewarned, it’s not as easy as it looks. Before 
you jump onto the landlord bandwagon, make sure you’re prepared for the 
realities of life as Mr. or Ms. Roper.<BR><BR><B>Stock Up for the Lean 
Times</B><BR>First and foremost, being a landlord does not equal instant money. 
Save enough cash to cover the periods your unit sits unoccupied, because you are 
guaranteed interludes with no incoming rent to cover your mortgage payment. 
Despite tax write-offs, your first year of owning a rental property will most 
likely operate at a loss.<BR><BR>Additionally, you must set aside a pool of 
funds to cover both planned and unexpected repairs. Each year or so, you’ll want 
to paint, have the carpets professionally cleaned, make small repairs (that 
windowpane crack is only going to get bigger) and have the central air or 
furnace inspected. You could get hit with the cost of a new refrigerator, hot 
water heater or other major appliance. If you’re burdened with exceptionally 
sloppy tenants, the cost to make your rental unit livable again could be 
substantial.<BR><BR><B>The People in Your Neighborhood</B><BR>As you search for 
properties, don’t assume you can turn any structure into a rental unit. Some 
communities forbid or frown upon having renters in the neighborhood. Do your 
homework. Check with your realtor, the municipality and prospective neighbors 
before plunking down a nonrefundable deposit.<BR><BR>Before you bid on a 
property, explore the vicinity. An abundance of other properties for sale or 
rent could indicate an undesirable location. Regardless, a glut of units could 
make your search for tenants difficult.<BR><BR><B>Law and Order</B><BR>Each 
state has different landlord-tenant laws covering leases and evictions. Research 
your area’s regulations before you make a costly miscalculation, such as not 
knowing how to legally divest yourself of deadbeat renters.<BR><BR>Check out 
www.landlord411.com which has links to all fifty states’ landlord-related laws. 
Also, invest in a conversation with a real estate attorney who can walk you 
through your rights as a landlord. Finally, if there are any landlord 
associations in your region, seek them out and consider joining; after all, 
there’s power, strength, and knowledge in numbers.<BR><BR><B>Dirty 
Details</B><BR>What will happen if you go on vacation and your renters need 
help? Are you going to hire a property manager or do the fix-ups yourself? How 
will you accept the rent? In person? Via checks? Through credit cards? You need 
to answer these and other questions before your first tenants step foot inside 
your unit; otherwise, you could find yourself in an unenviable 
position.<BR><BR>You also need to consider how often you plan on raising the 
rent. This decision cannot be made arbitrarily; weigh the pros and cons of a 
rent increase based on the location of your property, the status of your tenants 
(have they been with you for a long time?) and the general 
market.<BR><BR><B>Check ‘Em Out</B><BR>When considering prospective tenants, 
check on their credentials. While some landlords eschew tenant screening, most 
professional associations recommend that you at least do a credit history check 
and call all references, including former landlords. Keep in mind the 
prospective tenant’s current landlord could provide you with a glowing report to 
rid himself of a bad egg, while past landlords are more likely to be 
honest.<BR><BR>Even if your gut tells you someone will be a good renter, proceed 
with caution. A credit check might cost a few dollars, but you can recover the 
outlay by requiring all serious prospective renters to pay an application fee. 
It’s far better to know upfront that folks are bad news. Once they invade your 
building, it can be far more problematic and expensive than a credit check fee 
to get them out.<BR><BR><B>Stick to Your Guns</B><BR>If you can’t be firm, the 
landlord lifestyle might not be for you. If you’re a big softie but determined 
nonetheless, hire a property manager to do the tough stuff. If you’re willing to 
be consistent in the face of angry tenants and potential disputes, you could 
make a little dough.<BR><BR>If you have a “no pets allowed” policy, abide by it. 
Don’t allow Spot to turn your spotless carpet into a latrine. If you have 
explicitly stated there is to be no smoking indoors, make no exceptions even if 
Gramps complains about smoking outside in the dead of winter. If you expect the 
rent by the 5th, don’t allow the Millers off the hook because you feel sorry for 
them. It’s a slippery slope; they may never regain their financial footing once 
you let them slide once.<BR><BR>It’s better to maintain a professional 
relationship with your renters, as it will be easier for you to enforce rules, 
raise the rent, and evict if necessary. Some landlords have a practice of living 
offsite or hiring a property manager so they aren’t tempted to form close bonds 
with their renters. Be cordial, be polite, but try to keep your 
distance.<BR><BR><B>Did Someone Hear a Phone Ring?</B><BR>As a landlord, prepare 
for the phone to ring at all hours. Unless you specifically tell renters that 
you will only receive non-emergency calls during certain daytime hours, you may 
wind up hearing from your tenants at midnight or later.<BR><BR>There are many 
issues to consider when you’re deciding whether to become a landlord. It’s a 
24/7 job that can sometimes produce more headaches than cash. However, by 
considering all the facts, you can go into your new role with a sense of 
security and strength.<BR>
