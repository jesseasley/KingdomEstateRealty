<span class=pageheading>Understanding Capital Gains in Real Estate</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=text>
When
you sell a stock, you owe taxes on your gain—the difference between what you
paid for the stock and what you sold it for. The same is true with selling a
home (or a second home), but there are some special considerations.
<br><br><b>
How to Calculate Gain</b><br>

In real estate, capital gains are based not on what you paid
for the home, but on its adjusted cost basis. To calculate this:<br><br>

<ol class=text>
	<li>Take the purchase price of the home: This is the sale
	price, not the amount of money you actually contributed at closing.</li>


	<li>Add adjustments:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Cost of the purchase—including transfer fees, attorney fees,
inspections, but not points you paid on your mortgage.</li>

<li>Cost
     of sale—including inspections, attorney’s fee, real estate commission, and
     money you spent to fix up your home just prior to sale.</li>

<li>Cost
     of improvements—including room additions, deck, etc. Note here that
     improvements do not include repairing or replacing something already
     there, such as putting on a new roof or buying a new furnace.</li>
</ul>

	<li>The total of this is the adjusted cost basis of your
home.</li>

<li>Subtract this adjusted cost basis from the amount you
sell your home for. This is your capital gain.</li></ol>

<b>A Special Real Estate Exemption for Capital
Gains</b>
<br>
Since 1997, up to $250,000 in capital gains ($500,000 for a
married couple) on the sale of a home is exempt from taxation if you meet the
following criteria:


<ul class=text>
 <li>You
     have lived in the home as your principal residence for two out of the last
     five years.</li>
 <li>You
     have not sold or exchanged another home during the two years preceding the
     sale.</li>
</ul>



Also note that as of 2003, you also may qualify for this
exemption if you meet what the IRS calls “unforeseen circumstances,” such as
job loss, divorce, or family medical emergency.</SPAN>
