<span class=pageheading>5 Ways to Speed Up Your Sale</span><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li>Price it right.
Set a price at the lower end of your property’s realistic price range.</li>

<li>Get your house
market-ready for at least two weeks before you begin showing it.</li>

<li>Be flexible about
showings. It’s often disruptive to have a house ready to show on the spur of
the moment, but the more often someone can see your home, the sooner you’ll
find a seller.</li>

<li>Be ready for the
offers. Decide in advance what price and terms you’ll find acceptable.</li>

<li>Don’t refuse to drop the price. If your home has been
on the market for more than 30 days without an offer, be prepared to lower your
asking price.</li>
</ol>
