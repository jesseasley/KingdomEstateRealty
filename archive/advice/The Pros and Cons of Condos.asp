<span class=pageheading>The Pros and Cons of Condos</span>


<p class="text">Condominiums and townhouses offer an affordable option to
single-family homes in most areas. But consider these facts before you buy.</p>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Storage</b>.
     Some condos have storage lockers, but usually there are no attics or
     basements to store belongings.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Outdoor
     space</b>. Yards and outdoor areas are usually smaller in condos, so if
     you like to garden or entertain outdoors, this may not be a good fit.
     However, if you hate yard work, this may be the perfect option for you.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Amenities</b>.
     Many condo properties have swimming pools, fitness centers, and other
     facilities that would be very expensive in a single-family home.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Maintenance</b>.
     Many condos have onsite maintenance personnel to care for common areas, do
     repairs in your unit, and let in workers when you’re not home.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Security</b>.
     Many condos have keyed entries and or even door attendants. Plus, you’ll
     be closer to other people in case of an emergency.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Reserve
     funds and association fees</b>. Although fees generally help pay for
     amenities and provide savings for future repairs, you will have to pay the
     fees agreed to by the condo board, whether or not you’re interested in the
     amenity or not.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=7 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Resale</b>.
     The ease of selling your unit is more dependent on what else is for sale
     in your building, since units are usually fairly similar. Single-family
     homes usually are more individual.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=8 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Freedom</b>.
     Although you have a vote, the rules of the condo association can affect
     your ability to use your property. For example, some condos prohibit home-based
     businesses. Others prohibit pets. Read the covenants, restrictions, and
     bylaws of the condo carefully before you make an offer.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=9 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in left 5.25in'><b>Proximity</b>.
     You’re much closer to your neighbors in a condo or townhome. If possible,
     try to meet your closest prospective neighbors before making a decision.</li>
</ol>
