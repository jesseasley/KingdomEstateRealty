<span class=pageheading>Tips for Packing Like a Pro</SPAN><br><br>

<ol class=text>
<li>Develop a master “to do” list so you won’t forget
something critical.</li>

<li>Sort and get rid of things you no longer want or need.
Have a garage sale, donate to a charity, or recycle.</li>

<li>Don’t throw out everything. If your inclination is to
just toss it, ask yourself how frequently you use an item and how you’d feel if
you no longer had it.</li>

<li>Pack like items together. Put toys with toys, kitchen
utensils with kitchen utensils.</li>

<li>Decide what if anything you plan to move yourself.
Precious items, such as family photos, valuable breakables, or must-haves
during the move, should probably stay with you.</li>

<li>Use the right box for the item. Loose items encourage
breakage.</li>

<li>Put heavy items in small boxes so they’re easier to
lift. Keep weight under 50 lbs. if possible.</li>

<li>Don’t over-pack boxes and increase the chances they
will break.</li>

<li>Wrap every fragile item separately and pad bottom and
sides of boxes.</li>

<li>Label every box on all sides. You never know how
they’ll be stacked and you don’t want to have to move other boxes aside to find
out what’s there.</li>

<li>Use color-coded labels to indicate which room each
item should go in. Color-code a floor plan for your new house to help movers.</li>

<li>Keep your moving documents together, including phone
numbers, driver’s name, and van number. Also keep your address book handy.</li>

<li>Back up your computer files before moving your
computer.</li>

<li>Inspect each box and all furniture for damage as soon
as it arrives.</li>

<li>Remember, most movers won’t take plants.</li>
</ol>
