<span class=pageheading>Tips for Holding a Yard Sale</span><br><br>

<P class="text">Hold a yard sale to reduce the clutter in your home and get rid of
items you don’t want to move.</P>

<ol class="text">
<li>Check with your city government to see if you need a
permit or license.</li>

<li>See if neighbors want to participate and have a
“block” sale to attract more visitors.</li>

<li>Advertise. Put an ad in free classified papers, and
put up signs and balloons at major intersections and in stores near your home.</li>

<li>Price items ahead and attach prices with removable
stickers. Remember, yard sales are supposed to be bargains, so don’t try to
sell anything of significant value this way.</li>

<li>Check items before the sale to be sure you haven’t
including something you want by mistake.</li>

<li>Keep pets away from the sale.</li>

<li>Display everything neatly and individually so
customers don’t have to dig through boxes.</li>

<li>Have an electrical outlet so buyers can test
appliances.</li>

<li>Have plenty of bags and newspaper for wrapping fragile
items.</li>

<li>Get enough change, and keep a close eye on your cash.</li>
</ol>
