<span class=pageheading>7 Steps to Preparing for an Open House</span><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li>Hire a cleaning
service. A spotlessly clean home is essential; dirt will turn off a prospect
faster than anything.</li>

<li>Mow your lawn,
and be sure toys and yard equipment are put away.</li>

<li>Serve cookies,
coffee, and soft drinks. It creates a welcoming touch. But be sure the kitchen
has been cleaned up; use disposable cups so the sink doesn’t fill up.</li>

<li>Lock up your
valuables, jewelry, and money. Although the real estate salesperson will be on
site during the open house, it’s impossible to watch everyone all the time.</li>

<li>Turn on all the
lights. Even in the daytime, incandescent lights add sparkle.</li>

<li>Send your pets to
a neighbor or take them outside. If that’s not possible, crate them or confine
them to one room (a basement or bath), and let the salesperson know where to
find them.</li>

<li>Leave. It’s
awkward for prospective buyers to look in your closets and express their
opinions of your home with you there.</li>
