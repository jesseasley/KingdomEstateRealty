 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>A real
     estate transaction is complicated. In most cases, buying or selling a home
     requires disclosure forms, inspection reports, mortgage documents,
     insurance policies, deeds, and multi-page government-mandated settlement
     statements. A knowledgeable guide through this complexity can help you
     avoid delays or costly mistakes.</li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Selling
     or buying a home is time consuming. Even in a strong market, homes in our
     area stay on the market for an average of 60 days. And it usually takes
     another 60 days or so for the transaction to close after an offer is
     accepted.</li>

 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Real
     estate has its own language. If you don’t know a CMA from a PUD, you can
     understand why it’s important to work with someone who speaks that
     language.</li>

     </sup>have done it before. Most people buy and sell only a few homes in a
     lifetime, usually with quite a few years in between each purchase. And
     even if you’ve done it before, laws and regulations change. That’s why
     having an expert on your side is critical.</li>

     provide objectivity. Since a home often symbolizes family, rest, and
     security, not just four walls and roof, homeselling or buying is often a
     very emotional undertaking. And for most people, a home is the biggest
     purchase they’ll ever make. Having a concerned, but objective, third party
     helps you keep focused on both the business and emotional issues most
     important to you.</li>
