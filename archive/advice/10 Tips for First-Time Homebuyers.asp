<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Be
     picky, but don’t be unrealistic</b>. There is no perfect home.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Do
     your homework before you start looking</b>. Decide specifically what
     features you want in a home and which are most important to you.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Get
     your finances in order</b>. Review your credit report and be sure you have
     enough money to cover your downpayment and your closing costs.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Don’t
     wait to get a loan</b>. Talk to a lender and get prequalified for a
     mortgage before you start looking.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Don’t
     ask too many people for opinions</b>. It will drive you crazy. Select one
     or two people to turn to if you feel you need a second opinion.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Decide
     when you could move</b>. When is your lease up? Are you allowed to sublet?
     How tight is the rental market in your area?</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Think
     long-term</b>. Are you looking for a starter house with the idea of moving
     up in a few years or do you hope to stay in this home longer? This
     decision may dictate what type of home you’ll buy as well as the type of
     mortgage terms that suit you best.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Don’t
     let yourself be “house poor”</b>. If you max yourself out to buy the
     biggest home you can afford, you’ll have no money left for maintenance or
     decoration or to save money for other financial goals.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Don’t
     be naïve</b>. Insist on a home inspection and, if possible, get a warranty
     from the seller to cover defects within one year.</li>
<br><br>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Get
     help</b>. Consider hiring a REALTOR<sup><span style='font-family:Symbol;

     as a buyer’s representative. Unlike a listing agent, whose first duty is
     to the seller, a buyer’s representative is working only for you. And
     often, buyer’s reps are paid out of the seller’s commission payment.</li>
