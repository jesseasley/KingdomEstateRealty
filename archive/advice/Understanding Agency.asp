<span class=pageheading>Understanding Agency</SPAN><br><br>

<span class=text>It’s important to understand what legal
responsibilities your real estate salesperson has to you and to other parties
in the transactions. Ask your salesperson to explain what type of agency relationship
you have with him or her and with the brokerage company.</SPAN>

<ol class="text">

<li><b> Seller's representative</b>
(also known as a listing agent or seller's agent). A seller's agent is hired by
and represents the seller. All fiduciary duties are owed to the seller. The
agency relationship usually is created by a listing contract.</li>

<li><b> Subagent</b>. A subagent owes the same fiduciary duties to the agent's
principal as the agent does. Subagency usually arises when a cooperating sales
associate from another brokerage, who is not representing the buyer as a
buyer’s representative or operating in a nonagency relationship, shows property
to a buyer. In such a case, the subagent works <i>with</i> the buyer as a
customer but owes fiduciary duties to the listing broker and the seller.
Although a subagent cannot assist the buyer in any way that would be
detrimental to the seller, a buyer-customer can expect to be treated honestly
by the subagent. It is important that subagents fully explain their duties to
buyers.</li>

<li><b>Buyer's representative</b><i> </i>(also known as a buyer’s agent).<i> </i>A
real estate licensee who is hired by prospective buyers to represent them in a
real estate transaction. The buyer's rep works in the buyer's best interest
throughout the transaction and owes fiduciary duties to the buyer. The buyer
can pay the licensee directly through a negotiated fee, or the buyer's rep may
be paid by the seller or by a commission split with the listing broker.</li>

<li><b>Disclosed dual agent</b><i>.</i> Dual agency is a relationship in which
the brokerage firm represents both the buyer and the seller in the same real
estate transaction. Dual agency relationships do not carry with them all of the
traditional fiduciary duties to the clients. Instead, dual agents owe limited
fiduciary duties. Because of the potential for conflicts of interest in a
dual-agency relationship, it's vital that all parties give their informed
consent. In many states, this consent must be in writing. Disclosed dual
agency, in which both the buyer and the seller are told that the agent is
representing both of them, is legal in most states.</li>

<li><b>Designated agent</b> (also called, among other things, appointed agency).
This is a brokerage practice that allows the managing broker to designate which
licensees in the brokerage will act as an agent of the seller and which will
act as an agent of the buyer. Designated agency avoids the problem of creating
a dual-agency relationship for licensees at the brokerage. The designated
agents give their clients full representation, with all of the attendant
fiduciary duties. The broker still has the responsibility of supervising both
groups of licensees.</li>

<li><b> Nonagency relationship</b> (called, among other things, a transaction
broker or facilitator). Some states permit a real estate licensee to have a
type of nonagency relationship with a consumer. These relationships vary
considerably from state to state, both as to the duties owed to the consumer
and the name used to describe them. Very generally, the duties owed to the
consumer in a nonagency relationship are less than the complete, traditional
fiduciary duties of an agency relationship.</li>
