<span class=pageheading>Choices That Will Affect Your Loan</span>

<ol class=text>
<li>
Mortgages are generally available at 15-, 20-, or
30-year terms. The longer the term, the lower the monthly payment if the same
amount is borrowed. However, you pay more interest overall if you borrow for a
longer term.</li>

<li>Fixed or
adjustable interest rates. A fixed
rate allows you to lock in a low rate for as long as you hold the mortgage and
is usually a good choice if interest rates are low. An adjustable-rate mortgage
(ARM) is designed so that interest rates will rise as interest rates increase;
however they usually offer a lower rate in the first years of the mortgage.
ARMs also usually have a limit as to how much the interest rate can be
increased and how frequently they can be raised. ARMs are a good choice when
interest rates are high or when you expect your income to grow significantly in
the coming years.</li>

<li>Balloon
mortgages. Balloon mortgages offer
very low interest rates for a short period of time—often three to seven years.
Payments usually cover only the interest, so the principal owed is not reduced.
However, this type of loan may be a good choice if you think you will sell your
home in a few years.</li>

<li>Government-backed loans,
sponsored by agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration (<a class=text href="www.fha.gov" target="_empty">www.fha.gov</a>)
or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (<a class=text href="www.va.gov" target="_empty">www.va.gov</a>), offer special terms,
including lower downpayments or reduced interest rates</li>
