<span class=pageheading>Does Moving Up Make Sense?</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=text>
Answer these questions to help you decide whether moving up
makes sense.

<ol class=text>
<li>How much equity do you have in your home? Look at your
annual mortgage statement or call your lender to find out. Usually, you don’t
build up much equity in the first few years of paying a mortgage, but if you’ve
owned your home for a number of years, you may have significant unrealized
gains.</li>

<li>Has
your income increased enough to cover the extra mortgage costs and the costs of
moving?</li>

<li>Does your neighborhood still meet your needs? For
example, if you’ve had children, the quality of the schools may be more of a
concern now than when you first purchased.</li>

<li>Can
you add on or remodel? If you have a large yard, there might be room to expand
your home. If not, your options may be limited. Also, do you want to undertake
the headaches of remodeling?</li>

<li>How
is the home market? If it’s good, you may get top dollar for your home.</li>

<li>How
are interest rates? A low rate not only helps you buy more home, but also makes
it easier to find a buyer.</li>
</ol>
