<span class=pageheading>5 Property Tax Questions You Need to Ask</span><br><br>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>What
     is the assessed value of the property? Note that assessed value is
     generally less than market value. Ask to see a recent copy of the seller’s
     tax bill to help you determine this information.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>How
     often are properties reassessed and when was the last reassessment done?
     Generally taxes jump most significantly when a property is reassessed.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Will
     the sale of the property trigger a tax increase? Often the assessed value
     of the property may increase based on the amount you pay for the property.
     And in some areas, such as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">California</st1:State></st1:place>,
     taxes may be frozen until resale.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Is the
     amount of taxes paid comparable to other properties in the area? If not,
     it might be possible to appeal the tax assessment and lower the rate?</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Does
     the current tax bill reflect any special exemptions that you might not
     qualify for? For example, many tax districts offer reductions to those 65
     or over.</li>
</ol>
