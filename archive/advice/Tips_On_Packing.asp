<span class=pageheading>Tips On Packing</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=text>Let's face it, packing is a chore but it doesn't have to be that bad. With a 
little planning, supplies and a little ingenuity you can get it done by the time 
the moving truck arrives. Here are some packing tips I hope will get you to that 
goal. </SPAN>
<UL class=text>
<LI>Pack heavy items into small boxes, lighter items in larger boxes, maximum of 
30 pounds per box. 
<LI>Be sure to number boxes with a short description of the contents and the 
room they go in. 
<LI>For boxes with valuables in them make the description generic. 
<LI>Keep a detailed list of boxes and their contents so you can locate things 
quickly if needed. 
<LI>Tape power cords t o bottom or back of appliances. 
<LI>To prevent spills, tape shut boxes from the pantry, put bags of flour/sugar 
in large zip-lock bags and make sure jar lids are on tight. 
<LI>Tape can leave residue on furniture so use twine or elastic bands to secure 
drawers and doors. 
<LI>Use padding underneath rope or twine when securing furniture to avoid rub 
marks during moving. 
<LI>Fill your boxes and pack tightly with packing material so contents don't 
shift, rub or bang into each other. 
<LI>Pack TV and Stereo equipment in their original boxes and tighten shipping 
screws. Label cables and pack them in the same boxes with the equipment. 
<LI>Use towels or bedding to cushion fragile items. 
<LI>Pack a room at a time and finish it before moving to the next. 
<LI>When a room is packed, move the boxes to a designated staging area then 
vacuum and clean the emptied room. </LI></UL>
