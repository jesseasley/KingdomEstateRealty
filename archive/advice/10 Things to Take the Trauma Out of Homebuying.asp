<span class=pageheading>10 Things to Take the Trauma Out of Homebuying</span>
<br><br>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Find a
     real estate professional who’s simpatico. Homebuying is not only a big
     financial commitment, but also an emotional one. It’s critical that the
     practitioner you choose is both skilled and a good fit with your
     personality.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Remember,
     there’s no “right” time to buy, any more than there’s a right time to
     sell. If you find a home now, don’t try to second-guess the interest rates
     or the housing market by waiting. Changes don’t usually occur fast enough
     to make that much difference in price, and a good home won’t stay on the
     market long.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Don’t
     ask for too many opinions. It’s natural to want reassurance for such a big
     decision, but too many ideas will make it much harder to make a decision.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Accept
     that no house is ever perfect. Focus in on the things that are most
     important to you and let the minor ones go.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Don’t
     try to be a killer negotiator. Negotiation is definitely a part of the
     real estate process, but trying to “win” by getting an extra-low price may
     lose you the home you love.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Remember
     your home doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Don’t get so caught up in the
     physical aspects of the house itself—room size, kitchen—that you forget
     such issues as amenities, noise level, etc., that have a big impact on
     what it’s like to live in your new home.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=7 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Don’t
     wait until you’ve found a home and made an offer to get approved for a
     mortgage, investigate insurance availability, and consider a schedule for
     moving. Presenting an offer contingent on a lot of unresolved issues will
     make your bid much less attractive to sellers.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=8 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Factor
     in maintenance and repair costs in your post-homebuying budget. Even if
     you buy a new home, there will be some costs. Don’t leave yourself short
     and let your home deteriorate.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=9 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Accept
     that a little buyer’s remorse is inevitable and will probably pass. Buying
     a home, especially for the first time, is a big commitment, but it also
     yields big benefits.</li>
</ol>



<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=10 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Choose
     a home first because you love it; then think about appreciation. While <st1:place
     w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region></st1:place>
     homes have appreciated an average of 5.4 percent annually from 1998 to
     2002, a home’s most important role is as a comfortable, safe place to
     live.</li>
</ol>
