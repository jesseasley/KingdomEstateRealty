<span class=pageheading>FSBOs: Open House Tips</span><br><br>

<ul class="text">
<li><b>Advertise
     your open house</b>. Ideally you should advertise both the weekend before
     and the weekend of the open house. Check with the local paper to see when
     their ad closing deadlines are.</h3>


<li><b>Create
     a property summary sheet</b>. This sheet gives prospective buyers an
     overview of your home. Include dimensions for each room, copies of a
     property survey, summaries of utility costs and property taxes, and a list
     of when capital items, such as roofs and furnace, were added.


<li><b>Develop
     a sign-in form for prospects’ addresses</b>. You’ll ideally want both
     phone numbers and e-mail addresses to follow up with prospective buyers.</h3>


<li><b>Put
     up signs</b>. One or two days before the open house, place directional
     signs at major intersections within three to four blocks of your house. Be
     sure you check on anti-sign regulations in your area.</h3>

<li><b>Get
     your house ready</b>. Remove clutter, clean your house, wash your windows,
     add flowers, turn on lights, open draperies and blinds, remove valuables
     and breakables, confine pets, turn on soft music, and set up a table for
     your property fact sheet near the entrance.</h3>


<li><b>Develop
     a follow-up sheet</b>. Getting feedback on your home from prospects who
     attended your open house will give you a better understanding of how to
     make your home more appealing to buyers.</li>
