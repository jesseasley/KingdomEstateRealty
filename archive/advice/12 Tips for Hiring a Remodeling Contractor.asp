<span class=pageheading>12 Tips for Hiring a Remodeling Contractor</span><br><br>

<ol class=text>
<li>Get at least three written estimates.</li>

<li>Get references and call to check on the work. If
possible, go by and visit earlier jobs.</li>

<li>Check with the local Chamber of Commerce or Better
Business Bureau for complaints.</li>

<li>Be sure that the contract states exactly what is to be
done and how change orders will be handled.</li>

<li>Make as small a downpayment as possible so you won’t
lose a lot if the contractor fails to complete the job.</li>

<li>Be sure that the contractor has the necessary permits,
licenses, and insurance.</li>

<li>Be sure that the contract states when the work will be
completed and what recourse you have if it isn’t. Also remember that in many
instances you can cancel a contract within three business days of signing it.</li>

<li>Ask if the contractor’s workers will do the entire job
or whether subcontractors will do parts.</li>

<li>Get the contractor to indemnify you if work does not
meet local building codes or regulations.</li>

<li>Be sure that the contract specifies the contractor
will clean up after the job and be responsible for any damage.</li>

<li>Guarantee that materials used meet your
specifications.</li>

<li>Don’t make the final payment until you’re satisfied
with the work.</li>
