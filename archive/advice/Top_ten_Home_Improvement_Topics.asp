<span class=pageheading>Top 10 Home Improvement Topics</SPAN><br><br>
<span class=sectionheading>What’s on the minds of your fellow DIYers</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class="text">From my perch as the host of The Money Pit Home 
Improvement Radio Show and AOL’s Home Improvement Editor, I hear about home 
improvement challenges, wish lists and how-to questions year round. And as 
individual as these questions are, the topics are very similar.<BR><BR>The truth 
is that most of our homes are built pretty much the same way and have been for 
more than a couple of centuries. Sure we’ve got fancier furnaces and drywall 
instead of plaster walls, but for the most part homes still show wear-and-tear 
and break down the same way they have for a very long time.<BR><BR>To help you 
avoid home improvement hassles of your own, here are the top ten topics we get 
the most questions on, and some solutions that will save you some time and 
money:<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class="text"><B>10. Indoor air quality and mold</B><BR>Increased 
awareness of the health impact of indoor air quality sends many consumers to the 
phone or their computer in search of ways to make improvements in their home 
environment. Many queries are related to such HVAC issues as filtration, 
moisture and humidity, but avoiding construction materials that can become home 
to molds is also critical. In addition to just plain keeping your home 
well-ventilated, carpeting and paper-based drywall should stay out of 
potentially damp spaces. Georgia-Pacific has created an alternative for the 
latter with its <A class="text" 
href="http://www.gp.com/build/product.aspx?pid=4659">DensArmor Plus</A> 
paperless wallboard, composed of moisture-resistant glass-mat surfacing around a 
mold-resistant gypsum core.<BR><BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV class="text"><B>9. Basements and crawl spaces</B><BR>The underground 
spaces of a home are full of mysteries, and one of the biggest of these is how 
water can seep in so quickly and turn a previously dry basement or crawl space 
into one big puddle. The solution is usually simple, and all you have to do to 
find it is look up and around. Most flooding is caused by poor drainage 
conditions like clogged gutters or soil that slopes into a house. Fix these 
problems and you’ll have nice, dry subterranean spaces for accessing utilities 
or conversion to bonus living areas.<BR><BR><B>8. Bugs, pests and 
rodents</B><BR>Plenty of varmints and vermin would like to make your home their 
own, and prevention usually leads back to issues of drainage, sealing and 
storage of pest-attracting substances. Termites, which cause around five billion 
dollars in damage a year, drive many of our listeners on home pest quests, and 
we’ve found that the best solution is a professionally administered product 
called <A class="text" href="http://www.termidorhome.com/">Termidor</A>. Applied directly to 
the soil by pest control pros, Termidor can’t be seen or smelled by hungry 
termites, who very happily and unwittingly take it back to the nest to pass on 
to the rest of their community. As a result, termites disappear from your 
property and don’t return.<BR><BR><B>7. Kitchen and bath</B><BR>Updating a space 
is the lead interest among kitchen and bath callers, and we’re always glad to 
hear it, since it’s one of the best investments you can make in your home (up to 
75 percent of which can be recouped when you sell). The scope can range from a 
countertop replacement to a full-blown redo, but in the end, enhanced value and 
utility are common across the board. Mold and mildew resistance in the bathroom 
are also important to home improvers, and in addition to cleaning tips, we 
dispense advice regarding moisture-resistant finishes such as Kilz paint and DAP 
caulk, which contains mold-resistant Microban.<BR><BR><B>6. Roofing</B><BR>As 
soon as the weather starts to get rough, the roofing questions rain down thanks 
to the interior damage and other hints homeowners are receiving from above. 
Depending on the material and age of a roof, it may be time to budget for 
replacement (something many roofing callers to The Money Pit are trying to 
repair their way away from), or a repair job may put a cap on the trouble. In 
both cases, sufficient flashing is key-it’s the material that roofers use to 
bridge the gaps between intersections of roof and siding, as well as the areas 
around pipes and chimneys.<BR><BR><B>5. Walls and ceilings</B><BR>Maintaining a 
smooth, clean, secure canvas for room decoration is the leading concern in the 
walls and ceilings category, with homeowners looking to address the nail pops, 
stains and occasional mold issues that can literally drive them up a wall. Then, 
it’s on to the fun part: selecting a finish. When it comes to paint sheens, we 
encourage purchase of the best-quality paint available, often in a flat finish 
that will hide the imperfections otherwise magnified by light-reflecting gloss 
finish.<BR><BR><B>4. Windows and siding</B><BR>These portions of a home’s 
“envelope” lead to many questions about replacement, safe removal (asbestos is a 
concern with some older siding products), and maintenance, Consumers are also 
seeking out more design options in windows, and can now get energy savings right 
along with a great new look. Energy Star-rated windows abound, and the National 
Fenestration Rating Council also provides a standard by which you can make an 
apples-to-apples comparison when looking through window options. Watch for the 
<A class="text" 
href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=windows_doors.pr_ind_tested">NFRC</A> 
label on products, which includes ratings for U-factor, solar heat gain 
coefficient, visible transmittance, air leakage and condensation 
resistance.<BR><BR><B>3. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning</B><BR>The 
most complicated systems in your home can cause the most puzzling dilemmas, as 
Money Pit listeners most certainly know. Homeowners aren’t sure how much to 
spend on efficiency, and right along with 2006 changes in energy standards, the 
typical equipment sales process tends to raise more questions than it answers. 
With a currently operable system, proper maintenance is the key to carefree 
heating and cooling. Pre-season cleaning and tuning also contribute to 
dollar-saving efficiency.<BR><BR><B>2. Plumbing</B><BR>Running and clogging 
toilets, dripping faucets and drains that don’t seal drive many homeowners to 
distraction. Over half of the plumbing calls to The Money Pit have been of the 
911 variety, and those looking to make replacement purchases or redesign a 
bathroom have future plumbing annoyance avoidance in mind. Efficiency is also a 
concern, and thankfully the EPA has begun designating products that fit the bill 
under its new <A class="text" href="http://www.epa.gov/owm/water-efficiency/">WaterSense</A> 
labeling program. Qualifying high-efficiency toilets are already on the market, 
and low-flow shower heads and under-sink flow restrictors will also be available 
soon.<BR><BR><B>1. Flooring</B><BR>This is a hot topic thanks to all of the 
materials choices out there, many of which are easier than ever for homeowners 
to install on their own. DIYers are also interested in new technologies, 
differences among materials, and what’s best in finishes and finishing. And of 
course, there are also repair concerns, with floor squeaks being the loudest on 
the list. If this is the case for you, here’s what to do: For a squeak coming 
from under a carpeted floor, use a stud finder to locate the floor joist, and in 
the area of the squeak, nail right through the carpet and into the joist with a 
galvanized finish nail. Then grab the carpet by the nap and pull it up so that 
the nail passes through, and the squeak will disappear right along with the head 
of the nail.<BR>
