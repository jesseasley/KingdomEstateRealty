<span class=pageheading>Tips on Buying in a Tight Market</span>


<p class="text">Increase your chances of getting your dream house instead of
losing it to another buyer, with these easy steps.</p>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Get
     prequalified for a mortgage. You’ll be able to make a firm commitment to
     buy and make your offer more desirable to the seller.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=2 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Stay
     in close touch with your real estate sales associate to find out first
     about new listings that come on the market. And be ready to go see a house
     as soon as it goes on the market.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=3 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Scout
     out new listings yourself. Look at Internet sites, newspaper ads, and
     drive by the neighborhood frequently. Maybe you’ll see a brand-new “for
     sale” sign before anyone else.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=4 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Be
     ready to make a decision. Spend lots of time in advance deciding what you
     must have so you won’t be unsure when you have the chance to make an
     offer.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=5 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Bid
     competitively. You may not want to start out offering the absolute highest
     price you can afford, but don’t try to go too low to get a deal. In a
     tight market, you’ll lose out.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=6 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Keep
     contingencies to a minimum. Restrictions such as needing to sell your home
     before you move or wanting to delay the closing until a certain date can
     make your offer unappealing. In a tight market, you’ll probably be able to
     sell your house rapidly. Or talk to your lender about getting a bridge
     loan to cover both mortgages for a short period.</li>
</ol>


<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=7 type=1>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Don’t
     get caught in a buying frenzy. Just because there’s competition doesn’t
     mean you should just buy anything. And even though you want to make your
     offer attractive, don’t neglect inspections that help ensure that your
     house is sound.</li>
</ol>
