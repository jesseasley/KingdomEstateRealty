<span class=pageheading>5 Things to Understand About Homeowners Insurance</SPAN><br><br>

<ol class="text">
<li>Look for
exclusions to coverage. For example,
most insurance policies do not cover flood or earthquake damage as a standard
item. These coverages must be bought separately.</li>

<li>Look for
dollar limitations on claims. Even if
you are covered for a risk, there may a limit on how much the insurer will pay.
For example, many policies limit the amount paid for stolen jewelry unless
items are insured separately.</li>

<li>Understand
replacement cost. If your home is
destroyed you’ll receive money to replace it only to the maximum of your
coverage, so be sure your insurance is sufficient. This means that if your home
is insured for $150,000 and it costs $180,000 to replace it, you’ll only
receive $150,000.</li>

<li>Understand
actual cash value. If you choose not
to replace your home when it’s destroyed, you’ll receive replacement cost, less
depreciation. This is called actual cash value.</li>

<li>Understand
liability. Generally your homeowners
insurance covers you for accidents that happen to other people on your property,
including medical care, court costs, and awards by the court. However, there is
usually an upper limit to the amount of coverage provided. Be sure that it’s
sufficient if you have significant assets.</li>
