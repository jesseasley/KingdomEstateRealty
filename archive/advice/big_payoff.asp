<span class=pageheading>Home Improvement Ideas That Will Pay Off Big</SPAN><br><br>
<DIV class=text>There are two ways to 
go about making home improvements. Either you splurge for something purely for 
the pleasure of having it — the Italian marble bathroom you’ve dreamed 
about; that skylight that your spouse has been hinting at for the last six years 
— or you take a pragmatic approach, buying an energy-efficient furnace or 
repairing a leaky roof because you want to increase your home’s market 
value.

<BR><BR>Exactly how much you’ll recoup in costs depends on several factors, 
including the direction of the broader housing market, the value of the homes in 
your neighborhood, when you plan to sell the home and the nature of the project 
itself.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Kitchens</STRONG><BR><BR>Even a few basic improvements to your 
kitchen can pay handsome dividends, says real-estate agent Michael Murphy in his 
book “How to Sell Your Home in Good or Bad Times.” Murphy writes: “For most 
buyers, [the kitchen] is the heart of the house. Paint, wallpaper, and even 
refloor the room if necessary. Consider sanding, staining or painting 
dingy-looking cabinets. Replace old cabinet hardware — a low-cost improvement 
that makes a big difference in appearance.” Just be sure to go with a classic 
design and, if possible, use high quality materials, says Remodeling magazine’s 
Cory. After all, good taste endures.

<P>The average amount spent on a major kitchen-remodeling job in the U.S. is 
$54,241 for a midrange update; an upscale designer makeover averaged $107,973, 
according to Remodeling magazine. The midrange kitchen overhaul nationally 
recouped 80% of its cost and 76% of the costs were recovered in an upscale 
makeover.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Creating New Space</STRONG><BR><BR>As a 
rule, improvements that increase the functional space of a home hold their value 
longer than ones that just make a house look better. It’s also significantly 
cheaper than adding an addition to your home. Converting an attic into a 
bedroom, for example, usually costs about $35,960 and returns about 80% of its 
cost, according to Remodeling magazine. Turning your basement into a room for 
socializing will set you back, on average, $56,724, and allow you to recoup 79% 
of your costs.

<BR><STRONG><BR>An Extra Bathroom</STRONG><BR><BR>Adding an extra 
bathroom with all the trimmings — marble vanity top, molded sink, bathtub with 
shower and ceramic tile — almost pays for itself. A midrange full-bath 
remodeling job in the U.S. has an average price tag of $12,918 and recoups 85% 
of the costs. A midrange full-bath addition has a national average cost of 
$28,918 and generally recoups 75% of its 
cost.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Decks</STRONG><BR><BR>Installing a deck may be the most 
cost-efficient way to add square footage to your house, and of all the outdoor 
home improvements except painting, it may be the most reliable value. Deck 
additions average $14,728 and generally recoup 77% of their value. That may not 
sound terribly impressive, but other touted outdoor improvements fare much 
worse.

<BR><BR><STRONG>New Windows</STRONG><BR><BR>The savings on your utility bill might 
make up for the spotty resale value. Replacing 10 three-by-five-foot windows 
with insulated wood replacement windows typically costs $9,416 and recovers more 
than 85% of its costs at resale, according to Remodeling magazine.</P>

<STRONG>STAY AWAY</STRONG> from investing money into Manicured Gardens and 
Swimming Pools, they almost have no resale value at all, and you will be 
spending anywhere between $40k-$60k.<BR></DIV>
