<span class=pageheading>Cleaning Up Your Credit</span><br><br>
<span class="text">If you haven't yet applied for a mortgage and are worried about your credit 
rating, here are some tips to help clean up your credit and get the loan you 
need. </span>
<UL class="text">
<LI>Eliminate credit card debt as much as possible and pay down as many as you 
can. Having a balance on multiple cards will hurt your credit score. 
<LI>Get a copy of your credit report to see what the lenders will see. You can 
get these reports at minimal cost and in some states you get one free. Two of 
the major credit reporting companies are <A class="text" title=http://www.equifax.com/ 
href="http://www.equifax.com/">Equifax</A> and <A class="text" 
title=http://www.transunion.com/ 
href="http://www.transunion.com/">TransUnion</A>. 
<LI>Review your credit report, it may show you credit or charge cards from 
gasoline companies, department stores, etc. that you never use. Cancel these 
unused cards; this potential debt on your report will hurt your score. 
<LI>Also look at your past credit history for errors and get them corrected with 
the credit-reporting agency. 
<LI>Don't fill out every credit card application you receive in the mail, every 
application will result in a check on your credit and this is recorded in your 
credit history. A mortgage company will ask why you're trying to take on more 
credit card debt. 
<LI>If you have any tax liens, bankruptcies or court judgments that have been 
paid or dismissed and are over 7 years old then contact your credit reporting 
agency about getting them removed from your report. 
<LI>If you don't have a good credit history (or none at all) then you need to 
establish one. Apply for a credit card at a local department store or a small 
loan with your bank or credit union. If you're denied credit then you might ask 
a friend or relative to co-sign on a loan with you. 
<LI>Be wary of companies that say they can repair your credit. Unless there are 
errors on your credit history they cannot get bad debt removed from your record. 
Check with your state attorney general before contacting a debt repair company.
