 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Tax
     breaks</b>. The U.S. Tax Code lets you deduct the interest you pay on your
     mortgage, property taxes you pay, and some of the costs involved in buying
     your home.</li>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Gains</b>.
     Between 1998 and 2002, national home prices increased at an average of 5.4
     percent annually. And while there’s no guarantee of appreciation, a 2001
     study by the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS<sup><span style='font-family:

     found that a typical homeowner has approximately $50,000 of unrealized
     gain in a home.</li>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Equity</b>.
     Money paid for rent is money that you’ll never see again, but mortgage
     payments let you build equity ownership interest in your home.</li>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Savings</b>.
     Building equity in your home is a ready-made savings plan. And when you
     sell, you can generally take up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married
     couple) as gain without owing any federal income tax.</li>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Predictability</b>.
     Unlike rent, your mortgage payments don’t go up over the years so your
     housing costs may actually decline as you own the home longer. However,
     keep in mind that property taxes and insurance costs will rise.</li>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Freedom</b>.
     The home is yours. You can decorate any way you want and be able to
     benefit from your investment for as long as you own the home.</li>
 <li class="text" style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Stability</b>.
     Remaining in one neighborhood for several years gives you a chance to
     participate in community activities, lets you and your family establish
     lasting friendships, and offers your children the benefit of educational
     continuity.</li>
