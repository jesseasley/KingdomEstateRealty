													My family and I were moving out of state two years ago and it 
													couldn’t have been at a worse time as far as the real estate 
													market was concerned.  When we decided to move, we engaged 
													Jess Easley as our real estate agent to help us sell our home.  
													He walked us through the process and answered all our questions.  
													Although our expectations were unreasonable in hindsight, Jess 
													stood by our decisions on our asking price.  He told us that 
													the market would probably not support our asking price but he 
													was willing to do what he could.
													<br><br>
													After several weeks and price adjustments, there was little 
													hope in getting what we thought to be a decent price.  We asked 
													Jess about leasing out the house and he agreed to manage our 
													property.  At this point, he became more of a partner than 
													just an agent.  We were able to lease our house for several 
													months until the market started to turn around.  When we felt 
													it was time, we had Jess relist the property and we finally 
													sold our home for close to what we were hoping for.
													<br><br>
													During our partnership with Jess, we felt very comfortable 
													knowing that someone was looking out for us and our home 
													while we lived 700 miles away.  Whenever a problem or issue 
													arose, Jess was always willing to get to the house and set 
													our minds at ease.  When it came to pricing and listing the 
													house, Jess advised us but made sure we had the final say 
													on all matters.  If we were not as stubborn, we would have 
													sold our home much sooner but we were glad to have Jess 
													watching out for us.
													<br><br>
													A very satisfied client.

													Working with Jess Easley on the sale of our home was easy. 
													During the difficult years of house sales he took his job 
													seriously yet was honest to his word. When we told him he’d 
													have to sale the house “as is” because, although it was 
													not a foreclosure, we simply did not have the time, energy 
													or resources to do any fix-up, he understood and never 
													tried to pressure us on changes even though several weeks 
													passed before an offer came in.
													<br><br>
													We appreciated his efforts and support in trying to decide 
													on our future destination. His time and promptness proved 
													his dedication and made us feel like a priority on his busy schedule.

													I had a great experience working with Jess Easley. 
													I was a first time home buyer and Jess did a good job 
													getting me the answers to all my questions. He made it 
													seem simple and is very easy-going. I would definitely 
													recommend Jess to anyone.

													I wanted to take the time to say thanks for all of the advice and

													You represented my interests,

													You went above and beyond supporting me with house repair suggestions
													, labor options, and even rolled up your sleeves a few times to 
													step in and help.  You never gave up, even during a downturn in the 
													economy, and at the end, were able to sell my house for a fair 
													price during difficult times.  I appreciate your hard work and 
													diligence throughout this process.  Not only did I have a hard 
													working Realtor, but I made a friend along the way.
													<br><br>
													Stay in touch!

													I appreciate your EMAILs very much, and I want to tell you how a previous 
													message about getting your house in "curb-appeal" order helped in the case of 
													the front door, as you advised specifically about.
													<br><br>
													Our door looked terrible, and all the "varnished" doors are getting to look 
													the same in our subdivision, the result of improper pre-treatment and poor 
													varnish applications by the builder. Well, I sanded and scraped, but still the 
													door looked like a poor candidate for re-staining and re-varnishing, especially 
													since the dark surface mildew so common to fencing had appeared in areas. I also 
													don't entertain the idea of removing my front door to do a full removal since 
													it's the primary gateway to my home's security.

													Well, I went to Sherwin Williams and got some crabapple-colored darkish red 
													enamel, and I wound up painting the thing, and it looks great! Yes, it looks 
													great not only from the curb but from drive-by views as well.Thanks for the advice, Jess! You know, I've gone to countless garage, 
													estate and in-home sales, and some of these places leave you with the opinion 
													of, "who would want to buy this place?". That's why your advice is so 
													well-appreciated.
